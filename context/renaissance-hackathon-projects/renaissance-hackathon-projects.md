## XFriends (by CharacterX)

### Description
XFriends is a AI co-creation & co-governance platform built for AI social economy. Using Solana Token Extensions Technology, it allows AI beings to own their own souls - Synthetic DIDs in the form of wallets, and thereby independently manage their AI data assets and economic profits distribution. 

XFriends is part of the larger project CharacterX, a synthetic social network connecting humans and AI, which has, in less than half a year, attracted 1M users who spend 1 hour each day.  It is enrolled in the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator. Ownership of AI's digital assets as well as eagerness for opportunities in AI economy are the two major needs we find from CharacterX users. Therefore, we start to build XFriends platform to enable AI character investment, and synthetic DAOs based on AI shareholding.

## EnigmaVote

### Description
A system that enables confidential voting on solana blockchain using FHE enabled by zkVM and identity Verification of the voter to avoid fake voting using CIVIC decentralised Identity System.

### Details

- **Country:** United Arab Emirates
- **Additional Info:** ## Problem
The inherent transparency of blockchain technology, while facilitating easy verification and trust among users, also means that every transaction or data mutation is publicly visible, reinforcing the system's integrity and reliability. This very transparency paved the way for the rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which operate based on collective decision-making without centralized authority, often through blockchain-based voting systems. However, the public visibility of these votes within these blockchain based voting system can lead to many challenges such as -

1. Privacy Concerns: The transparency of blockchain transactions exposes users' financial and voting actions to public scrutiny, potentially compromising privacy.
2. Strategic Voting: With votes being visible, members might vote strategically based on how others have voted rather than their true preferences, which can skew the decision-making process.
3. Influence and Pressure: The visibility of votes before the conclusion of voting can lead to undue influence, where voters are swayed by the choices of early voters or those with significant influence within the DAO.
4. Security Risks: Public transactions and voting patterns can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as targeted phishing attacks or manipulation of vote outcomes.
5. Transparency vs. Anonymity: While transparency is crucial for trust and verification, finding the balance between transparency and voter anonymity remains a significant challenge to ensure fair and unbiased voting within DAOs.

On all the above issues, the core problem is the public visibility of the data on the blockchain. EnigmaVote is a full scale developer friendly solution to encrypt this public data, so anyone trying to snoop on the data is unable to make sense out of it.

## Solution
EnigmaVote is a full fledged infrastructure developed from scratch which devs can use to write their custom smart contracts capable of operating on encrypted data over the blockchain.

1. When the user sends the transaction to the smart contract, before calling the function on chain, it is first encrypted by the MPC based encryptor and the encrypted comes to the SDK.
2. SDK then calls the smart contract function with encrypted data as function parameters. Thus the smart contract operates on the encrypted data.
3. Computation on the encrypted data is gas heavy, therefore it is outsourced to zkVM based RISC0 proof computer which computes and provide the proofs to ensure that the operations performed are legit. The proof is then verified by the relayer deployed on the EVM chain and then finally states updated.
4. On chain every computation happened in encrypted domain, the user can decrypt the data later with the help of MPC based decryptor, after proving the ownership of data.

For this hackathon we have demonstrated it over the a simple voting system. We have implemented our own custom voting system and relay contract which stores the users vote in encrypted domain. All operations of voting like mark vote, update vote is done in encrypted domain, which is decrypted by the MPC decryptor to show the exact  value at the end of the ballot.

## SUBSCRIPTION BASED PAYMENT SERVICES

### Description
*ignore my broken english

in solana, we are lacking a payment gateway service which provides subscription mode. our aim is to provide the platform with integrated subscriptions method for dapps to charge their users, for their services. 

also, I didn't completed the project, as I was not able to find devs, with this, I know this is an excuse, as I was just stuck only on the idea. I am  good in evm based developments. no issue, I am learning solana too, will be able to create this soon, as it is a required feature on solana for user onboarding to using a service. apologies for providing my github repo instead of the project's because I have not created, thanks for reading this, if anyone is reading 😅

## DeTask: On Chain Work on Solana

### Description
Detask:  AI-enabled product development platform on Solana. 

Go from Prompt to Product. Intuitively fund and manage ideas, AI agents and Taskers. All in one chat.

Detask decomposes complex idea into small interconnected bits, assigning provable execution to AI agents and humans. 

Online work sucks. Current freelancing platforms fail to match skills with demand, due to poor way of assessing skillset and reputability. And it is very hard to manage freelancers, especially when one requesting doesn't have domain expertise.
We believe that the missing link to a true decentralized internet is democratizing knowledge through AI. 

We are 3 Cal grads. 2 AI bros turned into crypto bros, and 1 crypto bro turned into an AI bro. 
We noticed that our ML engineering job was becoming more and more API engineering, and it was obvious to us that how we do work is changing completely. We are entering an era of soft labeling, where our biggest contribution can be done by leveraging AI tools to the max. 
Soft labeling means execution open to anyone, from anywhere, with any background. Powering intuition by democratizing knowledge and money.

To leverage AI to the max, there needs to be a constant inflow of data coming in from our world. Which means, having verifiable execution aligned with human decision will be key, and we believe that is what have been missing in the DAO landscape. The openness of contribution.

## Echo: Cross Chain NFT P2P Swapping

### Description
At Echo, we're excited to join the Solana hackathon, seizing the opportunity to extend our NFT swapping platform to the Solana blockchain. With Solana's rapid rise in the NFT space, we're eager to provide Solana users with our secure and community-driven trading experience.

Our primary goal in this hackathon is to develop a cross-chain solution using Wormhole. By integrating Wormhole, we aim to expand our platform's accessibility to Solana users and pioneer seamless NFT trading across different blockchains.

During the hackathon, we made significant progress. We developed a prototype of a P2P swapping platform exclusively on Solana and initiated work on integrating Wormhole. Our roadmap includes a Solana launch followed by the incorporation of cross-chain functionality, enabling users to swap NFTs across multiple chains.

## PIPI the Cat

### Description
$PIPI the Cat started out as a Solana Memecoin, created by a group of Ethereum traders

When we launched the token we didn’t realize the potential in what we had created - however the community saw it early. We slowly realized the cynicism and amount rugs being pulled by a small handful of “devs” on Solana, stealing people’s money and tarnishing the reputation of our favorite blockchain. 

We decided we had to do something about it, after we saw how engaged @aeyakovenko and @rajgokal are with the Solana community. We are here to build on Solana long-term, and protect our extended community. 

We are looking to scale RPC nodes in Scandinavia, Europe where the electricity is low all year compared to other European countries. We are already applying for both national and regional funding, more info on this in our first meeting! Looking forward to share some juice.

I am currently building Stake.gg, which is a similar product, but does not share any code used in Davinci. Truthfully, I built this app in 3 hours on April, 8th, 2024 - and wish I spent more time on it because I believe it has potential. I hope to use what I learned building Davinci to either expand the Stake product offering or spin Davinci out into its own product and focus on it going forwards.

## ecoToken - Impact Bot

### Description
ecoToken is a cross-chain communication protocol and environmental credit aggregator allowing ecocredits from any source registry to be verified and sold on Solana. The impact bot allows any token on the Jupiter strict allow list to be immediately converted into an environmental impact via our smart contract. Each time the smart contract is hit with a payment from any token on the allowlist, it triggers a carbon credit retirement through the ecoLedger. This triggers the issuance of an Impact Certificate to the address that sent the funds, verifying the size of their environmental impact.

This is a smart contract that any application can utilize to incorporate environmental impacts into their apps. For example, games can have in-game impact with their native token, payment platforms can incorporate carbon options, and DePin projects can go carbon neutral with their native token in real time.

It is time to take profits for the planet and put our meme coins to work.

## Remake Protocol 

### Description
We are working on the Solana blockchain, providing a platform named Remake Protocol specifically designed for relaunching memecoins. Our platform supports meme coin communities that maintain an active community presence despite experiencing a significant drop in token prices. We offer them a pathway to relaunch their tokens successfully.

At Remake, we enable users to create pools and deposit any tokens they possess. Once the tokens in a pool reach a specified ratio of the circulating supply, we leverage bonding curves and virtual initial liquidity to facilitate the token's relaunch. This approach allows us to gather liquidity for the liquidity pool (LP). Following the accumulation of sufficient SOL in the pool, we add liquidity to the LP and initiate the distribution of deposit rewards for the relaunched token. These rewards can be claimed by the users involved in the process.

In the future, we aim to build a cross-chain relaunch protocol and a one-stop pre-launch & re-launch platform. We believe that community makes meme-coin. So the community can have one more chance to save the meme coin if harassed.

## Unruggable

### Description
Unruggable is a security/privacy focused soft/hard wallet designed specifically for solana that protects users from the most common rugs. It is effectively a solana cli wrapper written in pure bash with minimal dependencies, using a ATM(numbers) interface.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** https://www.unruggable.io/
https://www.unruggable.sh/


Pitch Deck

https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/3UgjUKQ1CAeaecg5CWk88q9jGHg8LJg9MAybp4pevtFz/unruggable_pitch.pdf



Long Form

Background & Motivation:
Team BGs

Unruggable was born as the team are FTX rug survivors, and also detest scams and how ‘unsafe’ crypto is. Current user protection on Solana has improved, but there is still room for improvement. Removing browser access with the capacity for signing transactions removes the majority of the most common threat vectors. The soft wallet version of unruggable which runs on the users local machine protects users from the most common exploits, and encourages better opsec practices, letting the user distinguish between  ’safe’ wallets and hot wallets, whilst also allowing them to fully leverage the capabilities of the solana network. With well defined bash code, and in line commenting, there is potential to incorporate locally run LLMs (AI) or integrate with a distributed compute network that hosts a trained LLM on the codebase, allowing the user to easily interact with the solana network using natural language. Locally hosted LLMs might restrict ease of use for most users and could be a pipe dream, however with the open source codebase, and well documented implementations, new protocols can provide their own functionality to be integrated into unruggable following the defined js/rust command line interface already provided. Similarly users can request specific features and protocol integration, and the unruggable team can add this functionality creating a user -> feedback -> feature loop that should help the user base grow organically. An example of this would be adding ore cli support to unruggable, cleaning up the mining process for users and simplifying their set up. The hardware wallet is designed to be significantly more limited in capacity with only essential functionalities, to reduce supply chain risk, enforce user opsec - hardware wallets should only be used to send funds out to less secure wallet, not for interacting with frontends, or executing swaps. The complete unruggable package would effectively have the user have three levels of wallets, the hardware wallet which is airgapped, offline and used as a bank vault, their unruggable soft wallet which keypairs are stored locally in a permissioned folder, with certain built in functionalities (i.e. solana on rails) and lastly their hot wallet of choice for using frontends and interacting with ecosystem protocols (Backpack/Phantom/ etc…). This approach is only enabled by solana’s miniscule fees and fast transactions allowing users to move funds through different levels of secure wallets quickly. 

Safe self custody is an issue dear to us, and is a proven value proposition for users. Our open source approach differentiates us from most wallets, and our focus and bet on focusing solely on Solana and its growth allows us to focus on one particular niche. With our features being taylored to someone who has some slight epxerience with solana already we expect user demand for more specialised wallet appplications focused on security to grow as the bull market continues and drains and scams become more widespread. Leading solana wallets reported usage numbers in the order of millions, and the addressable market for unruggable is any computer user with an interest in using Solana. 

Functionality
Compatible across any Ubuntu OS - MacOS, Linux, Windows via WSL
Goal is for a sub 3 minute setup on any operating system.
Full range of all ‘base wallet functionalities’
Receive 
Send
Tokens + NFTs
Address switching
In wallet staking, and stake account management
Keypair and seed generation
Custom RPC url configuration

Obscures/hides all spam NFTs/tokens
Code is fully open source 
Extensive ecosystem integrations already live in alpha testing - Jito, JUP, Pyth, Sanctum 

Codebase - a one file bash script with minimal dependencies (to reduce potential supply chain issues). Code is commented and laid out following industry standard bash approaches. One file approach allows users to easily check the code.

Modules/integrations - (Hermes, Calypso etc..) currently written as one file js command line tools, executed directly within unruggable. User never has to intereact with them, and they leverage the standardised Unrugabble layout to work. Modules will also be written in Rust to take advnatage of binary executables to potentially improve performance and setup.


Business Plan 
Wallets and self custody are a public good that should be freely available to anyone. This is one of the goals of unruggable, and a guiding belief in what we do and one of the reasons we chose to open source our codebase. 

However the devs need to be able to afford coffee, and in order to be able to scale it is important that there is a viable business plan. Unruggable aims to create two revenue streams:
1 - Hardware wallets
2 - Microfees for services

Let us initially focus on microfees for services. Basic wallet functionality, is freely available, but certain additional services are provided for the user which already charge a fee, unruggable simply adds an additional fee as a transfer instruction in the transaction created for the user. In the current alpha launch there are two such services provided, Hermes and Calypso. Hermes allows the user to take advantage of the Jito transaction endpoint, allowing them to send any transactions they make through unruggable to enjoy priority, and near instant execution. With the current congestion on Solana this is an invaluable proposition to users, allowing them to quickly and consistently execute transactions. Jito has already proven that tips for transaction priority is a viable business model, and unruggable follows this vein. 
The second service is Calypso - names so as it one of the moons of Jupiter. Calypso allows users to execute swaps on Jupiter without interacting with a website, whilst also utilising the Jito transaction endpoint to enhance the User experience and show off the speed of Solana. A microfee just like the fee charged by Jito is applied by unruggable for offering this service. For alpha we have elected to not implement a % fee on swaps like other frontends do.

Both these microservices have proven product market fit and integrate with market leading protocols on Solana. Combined with the current congestion and difficulty for human users to land transactions using hot wallets - and the fact unruggable provides a robust solution to the transaction landing issues utilisng Jito, this should provide an incentive for users to use unruggable. Trading bots have seen a surge in popularity as well, with BonkBot the telegram trading bot making ATH’s in fees accrued. Calypso allows for trading through JUP and combined with Athena, that utilises pyth historical data and the current price to passively trade for the user and accrue Jupiter volume whilst also hopefully profiting. 

Aside from the microservices the hard wallets offer an attractive margin. Hardware wallets consistently retail for more than 50USD, with customers preferring to buy directly from the manufacturer due to security concerns. Unrugabbles’ open source design and the fact it utilises any flash drive (USB and USBC) with more than 16GB of storage space allows for the physical devices to be acquired in bulk at a sub dollar cost per item. Of course unruggable does not provide the same range of crypto storage options (only SOL and BTC) and no hardware security features, a retail price of betwen 20-30 USDC seems reasonable. 

An initial production run of wallets (3000 or so) could be paired with either a token or NFT on the wallet similarly to the Saga model, to allow for further production and runway. The USB drive casings and packaging can be branded to further increase their retail appeal. Bitcoin support also opens up the opportunity for an ordinal to be packaged with the hardware device.

## Mimir_App

### Description
Just as Mimir, the wise figure from Norse mythology, was sought after for knowledge and insight, the Mimir_App emerges as the digital well of wisdom in the Solana ecosystem. Our app is built to illuminate the entirety of a user's cryptocurrency and NFT portfolio, with unparalleled clarity and intelligence.

Gone are the days of navigating through individual wallets. Gone are the days of wondering how your overall portfolio (or even segments of it) are doing over time. We eradicate the need for guesswork by offering a comprehensive, at-a-glance view that consolidates your tokens & NFTs into a single coherent narrative.

Even your initial wallet connection will start to yield a rich, detailed evolution of your portfolio's history.  This becomes even more powerful as you link more of your wallets to the account.  It becomes the place to track, analyze, and reflect on your assets' journey with real-time data & historical insights that guide your future decisions with precision and foresight. Beyond just tokens, your NFT assets will begin to shine with direct access to current floor prices. 

Mimir_App isn't merely a tool to look and learn, but also a place where you can swap tokens effortlessly with our connection to Jupiter or list your NFTs for sale directly on a marketplace of your choosing.

Unlike Odin, we won't require you to sacrifice an eye for all of this knowledge, but we will have a modest annual fee for access. Come with us and embrace the future of portfolio management where knowledge, like in the tales of old, is the greatest power.

## sBread Market

### Description
Generate delta-neutral yield for LPs, while allowing buyers to take directional risk on any asset. Spread Vaults enter an Iron Condor, selling call and put spreads to buyers as atomic positions. The vault profits off correctly guessing market volatility, taking minimal directional risk. Since the Vault is completely collateralized in stablecoin, a vault that sells no options is still at least as good as a managed stablecoin lending position.

To use the demo, mint yourself some USDC using the faucet page. Head to the Vault List page to deposit like an LP or buy options like a Buyer against a few common assets. The website is very much a work in progress, but prices are roughly representative of real pricing today. Head to the Admin Page to play around with creating your own Vaults.

## SolSentry

### Description
SolSentry is a Solana Telegram Trading bot, and the world's first crypto bot to offer a special kind of trade called a Trailing Stop Loss.

How does it work? From the moment your position is opened, the Trailing Stop Loss keeps track of the highest price your position has ever attained. That's called your position's Peak Price.

If the current price ever drops 5% (or any percent you chose) below your position's peak price, your position's tokens are automatically sold.  This is not the same as a Limit Order!

Trailing Stop Losses Lock in your Gains and Limits Your Losses, but there's plenty of other kinds of trades the SolSentry team is planning to implement, like the Dip Auto Buyer, the Wave Rider, and cool features like the Wallet Importer. See the pitch deck for all the cool details and our estimates of revenue and operating expenses.

Submission includes Deck + Video.

## Explanada

### Description
Explanada is a groundbreaking cultural discovery and event participation platform that revolutionizes the way individuals engage with local culture using the power of Solana. Born from the necessity to highlight the vibrant cultural scene in our city, Explanada offers a comprehensive real-time list and map of cultural events. The platform gained recognition by being incubated at the University of Brasília, showcasing its potential early on.

In a significant advancement, Explanada integrated Solana blockchain technology during the Colosseum hackathon, introducing a novel experience for users to purchase NFTickets directly within the app. This integration not only streamlines the event attendance process, including queue bypass and in-app purchases using Solana's cryptocurrency and tokens, but also enriches user engagement by rewarding participation with exclusive badges and NFTicket collectibles.

Explanada's vision extends beyond event listing to transforming into a comprehensive 'cultural wallet.' Through its DAO, users can contribute to the ecosystem by submitting events, participating in governance, and earning currency for their activities. This fosters a community-driven approach to cultural engagement, blending the realms of cultural appreciation and digital asset management.

Projected to tap into a Total Addressable Market of $214 billion, targeting a modest fraction to achieve significant revenue and community transactions, Explanada stands at the forefront of merging culture with the decentralized digital economy. Its multidisciplinary team, organized into four squads, underscores its innovative approach to redefining how culture and technology intersect, promising a future where cultural engagement and Web 3.0 converge seamlessly.

## FairDrop 

### Description
FairDrop is an open list of verified wallet addresses offering users exposure to Web3 airdrops and providing founders with a sybil-resistance and token farming solution.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** Introduction
FairDrop is an innovative project designed to address the common issues faced in the Web3 space, such as pump-and-dumps, token farming, and bot interference. By ensuring that project founders can distribute their tokens to unique, verified individuals, FairDrop aims to create a fairer and more equitable environment for everyone involved.

How it Works
- Users link their crypto or Phantom wallet to FairDrop.
- Users go through a one-time KYC process to prove their uniqueness.
- Once verified, the user's wallet is listed on the verified wallets page for projects to select when distributing tokens or NFTs.

KYC Process
The KYC process is a crucial step in ensuring the uniqueness of each person and guaranteeing an equal opportunity to receive an airdrop. All identity information is fully anonymous.  

For Project Founders
If you're a project founder, you're free to use the FairDrop list to distribute your tokens. The list is open for use and aimed at promoting a more equitable and sustainable airdrop outcome for the Web3 community. 

What to Expect as a User
By entering your wallet into FairDrop, you're essentially joining a whitelist. Project founders will have access to airdrop you their tokens and other Web3 collectibles as a reward for proving your uniqueness.

## InsureOS

### Description
We want apps/protocols to be able to purchase insurance for your codebase at a recurring monthly premium. This is a more dynamic way of assessing and mitigating code risk compared to static and expensive audits. In addition, you are compensated for monetary losses due to unseen vulnerabilities.

Since the premium is an APY earning opportunity, multiple Liquidity pools will bid to cover it and invest a portion of the earned premium into relevant code-level risk mitigation strategies on-chain.

### Details

- **Country:** India
- **Additional Info:** Our goal as a project is to make it super simple for fintech apps, defi protocols, and other infrastructure teams to offload codebase failure risk for a recurring premium. This ensures that users who compose on top of these apps or utilize them regularly can receive fair compensation for unexpected code risk without exposing protocol/company treasury to unlimited downside.

This plays on a much larger theme, that code as an asset class from the POV of insurance is much easier to represent and custody on-chain (as opposed to physical assets). Since it is also pure text, as zk approaches evolve in the Solana ecosystem, InsureOS' risk metrics and protocol coverage of closed-source codebases will become more accurate.

## VideolifeDAO with MeupWallet Dao Tool

### Description
Dear Members of Solana Foundation,

As Robfly Software Company, we have developed Videlifedao, a decentralized live conference and recording system. Built on WebRTC technology, this system offers advanced features for managing live broadcasts. Behind the scenes, WebRTC is used for encoding live streams, while Meupwallet DAO is integrated for recording private decisions.

Meupwallet DAO enables users to sign decisions with their personal private keys and then send these decisions to smart contracts on the blockchain. In Videlifedao, decisions made during live broadcasts are transmitted to all participants via the data channel and are transparently recorded on the blockchain. Additionally, members can confirm decisions through their web panel until the specified deadline.

We are presenting this project to Solana Foundation because of Solana's large community and its suitability for transparently recording community decisions on the blockchain. By making Meupwallet compatible with Solana, we aim to gain support from the Solana community and present our project in global hackathons.

Our project combines decentralized decision-making processes with live broadcast management, emphasizing transparency and participation. With the support of Solana Foundation, we believe our project will further grow and develop.

Best regards,
Mehmet ESEN, ROBFLY

## Owl Network

### Description
Overview
Owl Network is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain that aims to capture, integrate, and provide high-value Point of Interest POI data to enable the development of location-centric Web3 applications and services. The network leverages a unique combination of offline shared Power bank stations, known as Owl Stations, and blockchain technology to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital realm.
Building on a Solid Foundation
Owl Network is built on top of the Solana blockchain, which offers high performance, scalability, and low transaction costs. Solana's architecture enables fast and efficient processing of transactions, making it suitable for handling the data-intensive operations required by Owl Network.
Owl Stations
Owl Stations form the physical infrastructure of the Owl Network. These stations combine the functionality of charging banks and network nodes, serving as data capture points and enabling users to interact with the network. Owl Stations are strategically deployed in various locations to maximize the coverage and quality of the collected POI data.
Data Capture and Integration
Owl Stations are equipped with sensors and devices that capture location-based information, such as GPS coordinates, Wi-Fi signals, and Bluetooth beacons. The captured data is then securely transmitted to the Owl Network, where it undergoes validation and integration processes. The network employs various data validation techniques, including consensus algorithms and data quality checks, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the POI data.
Data Storage and Indexing
Overview 4 part 1

The validated POI data is stored on the Solana blockchain using efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Owl Network leverages advanced geospatial technologies, such as geohashing and spatial indexing, to enable fast and efficient querying and retrieval of location-based information. This optimized storage and indexing approach allows for seamless integration with location- based services and applications.
Smart Contracts and Applications
Owl Network provides a framework for developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that utilize the captured POI data to create location-centric applications. These applications can range from location-based services and geospatial analytics to proximity-based interactions and more.
Incentivization and Tokenomics
Owl Network incorporates an incentivization mechanism to encourage participation and contribution to the network. Users who provide valuable POI data through Owl Stations are rewarded with tokens or other incentives. The network's tokenomics model is designed to ensure the sustainability and growth of the ecosystem, aligning the interests of users, developers, and stakeholders.

## ascend

### Description
ascend is a mobile app that helps you achieve your goals

i believe our product deserve visual over words. it'd be easier for you to check our demo video, landing page or download our app to feel it
words will hardly convey the beautiful ui/ux & abstraction we iterate over for a month. so instead i'll use this short description to tell you why we built this

humans lie to themselves all the time. we find excuses. 
we know what's good for us and yet we don't do it!
how do we flip the script?

most web2 app optimise our brain chemistry against us for their benefits. our attention is their product to sell
ascend does the opposite. its built to leverage your brain chemistry for you.

the app is built around routines. 
internet says it takes 21 days to build an habit and 90 days to make it a permanent lifestyle change. 
that's why our challenges default choices are 7 days (try) 30 days (create the habit) 90 days (make it permanent)

we repurpuse the proven web2 playbook. the habit loop (craving, cue, action, reward)
the social, feed, rng, notifications etc... don't optimise for your screentime but for your success

to enter the arena download the app, grab your solana wallet & answer these 4 questions
- what challenge?
- how long?
- solo or multi?
- how much you dare to stake?

example of challenges (daily actions)
- make your todo 
- complete your flashcards
- commit on github
- post on twitter
- post on farcaster
- block your youtube shorts
- cap your instagram hours per day to x
- daily gym
- custom wildcards
- etc ...

the goal is for you to connect anything you want seamlessly. 
if you connect your watch for daily gym, you won't even need to open the ascend app to confirm challenges. only to create & withdraw from them

when you set up a challenge or are challenged by a friend you're forced to make a conscious choice:
are you willing to put something at stake? do you really want to do it? if yes then trap your future self. put something meaningful at stake

why web3: easier for us to build. no stripe api. easier for us to leverage other protocols, expose our programs, share value and grow the pie 

when ponzi: at first we focus on organic slow growth. finding our core users. understanding our niche. ponzi skew metrics but helps grow. 
we cannot play with incentives before we built something that people genuinely use. or when the bear rises again, when the tides pull out, we'll be swimming naked

ascend! the future is ours

## EcoFunds

### Description
EcoFunds is an innovative philanthropic funding platform, leveraging the Solana blockchain to revolutionize how we support underprivileged communities. Our mission begins with a focused campaign to bring solar energy to remote, electricity-deprived areas in Vietnam. By harnessing the efficiency of Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) on Solana, which offer near-zero minting costs, we're able to democratize the funding process for solar panel installations.

Imagine this: instead of seeking a single donation of 200 million VND, we issue 10,000 EcoPanel cNFTs at just 20,000 VND each. This approach not only makes the funding process more accessible but also allows us to engage a broader community in our efforts toward environmental sustainability and social upliftment.

Our commitment goes beyond installation. We aim to create a transparent and engaging donor experience by utilizing NFT technology not just as a funding tool but as a means to celebrate and showcase the contributions of our supporters. Furthermore, we're implementing a minimal system powered by the LoRaWAN protocol. This technology enables us to provide real-time updates on the energy generated by the installed solar panels, directly linking donors (our NFT holders) to the tangible impact of their contributions.

At EcoFunds, we're not just promoting environmental sustainability; we're building a community of donors who can see and feel the difference they're making in the lives of those in need. Join us in transforming lives through the power of blockchain and renewable energy.

## ClickCrate

### Description
Digital Sales is already hard but over coming years it will get even harder. 

People are increasingly experiencing ad fatigue resulting in Click-through-Rates failing advertisers and ads efficiency falling ~15-20%  YoY. The ever increasing Cost per Click as well as Cost per Mile as online sales increase are making the final product sale more and more expensive. Retail Media Networks rule e-commerce and ads with 80% of market attributed to 4 companies resulting in a direct sales monopoly. But perhaps worst of all in an unprecedented mark-up in the history of sales, app stores take a 30% cut from all sales in the form of in-app purchases. This is unsustainable and a shift has already begun. Increasing as ad spend and market competition is driving sales to move beyond the online store shopping experiences that we all know to a growing 310 million social media users. Novel methods like influencer 
driven sales, direct in-post purchasing, and flash sales during streams are seeing traction. Through it all it has become apparent that direct sales remain the most cost effective option. However, as social media is gobbled up by the big players gaming remains the next biggest and a somewhat untapped market for direct sales.

That is why we built CLICKCRATE. An easy to use API and soon to come SDK that allows game developers to sell real world assets in their game in as little as two clicks. To start when simply request an API Key, create/register your in-game Point of Purchase (POP) through the create-clickcrate/register-clickcrate endpoints, and when you’re ready to start earning integrate the make-purchase api call into your the game logic associated with your Point of Purchase (POP) to allow users to purchase embedded real world assets.

While your CLICKCRATE is being created sellers are similarly creating/registering their products and once they are in our system our dynamic algorithm secured by blockchain and soon to be powered by AI will automatically find the perfect product to place in your Point of Purchase (POP). As the inventory for a product placed into your Point of Purchase (POP) sells you will receive earnings according to the fee that you specified during your CLICKCRATE’s creation.

But the best part? Your sales are direct and your earnings from product placements are 100% yours, not beholden to the 30% fee of app stores.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** We had the idea for ClickCrate just this past Thursday and couldn't help but pivot from building a game because we saw the incredible potential of this solution to transform the world of e-commerce in digital experiences particularly gaming.  While we are proud of what we were able to put together in such a short amount of time this is by no means the end but very much just the beginning. We very much look forward to building out a full MVP, onboarding many games/products, transforming the gaming e-commerce experience, and helping onboard the next billion users to Solana!

## Rhizo Network

### Description
Rhizo Network is a network of decentralized compute resources. While not all programs would be acceptable to host on a public network, generative AI inference on open-source models happens to be a fantastic use-case. Millions of devices have untapped compute power that could be unlocked with a solution like Rhizo, providing options for more budget conscious generative AI solutions, and an open ecosystem of code to reuse.

Rhizo in its current form can execute Python code that is referenced on the Solana blockchain through Rhizo's smart contract.  It will serve a unit of source code, keyed by the Solana account key for that module. Rhizo nodes have the Rhizo Python SDK installed locally, giving hosted modules the ability to discover and query LLaMA servers registered on the Rhizo network.

Upon decentralizing and allowing compute providers to register on the Rhizo network, Rhizo plans on being the largest single source (in terms of model options) of public open source gen AI inference, with its decentralization giving it the ability to rapidly adapt to advancements in open-source models.

Rhizo has a playground accessible at www.playground.rhizo.dev

## Tank Battle - A Trustless P2P Game Server

### Description
I developed a protocol for trustless low latency communication between two parties. I then used this protocol to allow players to wager real money on the result of a fast paced fps game without having to trust a centralized server. I then developed a game and implemented the protocol to demonstrate its function. I used webrtc to implement a real time connection between two browsers running the game. In order to play, players must create a room and fund it with SOL. The other player then joins this room and also pays an amount of SOL. Players then open the webrtc connection and play, with the chain sending the funds to the winner upon the game's end. If both players are honest, the chain is only utilized at the end of the game allowing for extremely fast gameplay. However, if one player thinks that the other cheated, the chain is used as an arbitrator between the players. The chain then declares the honest player as the winner, sending them the funds. The protocol also handles users dropping their connection, declaring the one whose connection did not drop as the winner.

- **Additional Info:** The avatars in the video are not what we are completely settled on although we are confident in the incentive model to attract activity and be seen as something interesting enough for users to participate in for a prolonged period of time. 

With the right backing, we can get better avatars. 

2 things we did not get around to in the pitch deck were:

1) PEB: Points earning buffer. this is an anti-whale tool whereby a user that holds a certain number of avatars will experiencing a nerf score to the subsequent avatars they acquire. for example a user might own 3 avatars, and on upon acquiring the 4th, instead of that avatar eliciting a 20% boost to points earner, it experiences a 13.25% boost.

2) 10,000 PFP NFT collection: when avatars are fully kitted out with fashion items, the user can mint the corresponding NFT and those items become traits of the NFTs. Similarly, the fashion items are in finite supply when combined within an NFT. This triggers a race between users to earn points at a faster rate to eventually have a chance of minting some combination of the collection.

3) NFT-Lending. by minting the maxxed out NFTs, the owner would own an NFT that's backed by liquidity. this suddenly turns NFTs into very liquid assets and a mechanism could exist where, a lending provider collateralises a DripEX NFT and then has to liquidate it. but after liquidation there only exists an imbalance between the price an NFT was worth (assuming market conditions are constant) when it was minted, and when it was liquidated. the mechanism could allow lending providers to redeem the NFT and claim a proportion from the underlying liquidity to make up the difference and make lenders whole. once this has been completed, there exists a hole in DripEX. this present the opportunity for LPs, or other outside parties to bid on the difference to make the Liquidity pool whole again and re-mint the NFT.

This way, a user can come into DripEX, spend some arbitrary derivative amount of an entire liquidity position's worth, but own the full position's worth. as a brief illustrative example, a user could spend $2000 on this said auction, and command a liquidity position with $50k

## Dominion Game

### Description
A Clash of Clans-like game built on Solana with extra twists. In addition to the usual Clash of Clans gameplay, we offer extra features such as the Overworld - which composes of lands owned by players that can be occupied by other players, and the Governance system. The Governance system gamifies on chain governance votes to decide the fate of each guild. This in turn raises awareness about the importance of on chain governance to the masses. Guilds are represented by SPL-20 Tokens or NFTs, in other words, all memecoins can now be turned into governance tokens, removing the "useless" aspect of these coins while improving their social aspect.

## AI FHE (homomorphic encryption) app built with Healthcare IOT DePIN Devices, Pyth, Zama & Solana

### Description
Privacy-preserving AI & FHE represents a trillion dollar market spanning sectors such as healthcare, finance, commerce, gaming, real-world applications, and decentralized private networks, among others. The effectiveness of current AI, including large language models and generative AI, is impeded by the underutilization of private data due to privacy concerns. We have been at the forefront of integrating Solana blockchain technology with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to establish a marketplace for FHE-based AI. This innovation facilitates the deployment of privacy-preserving artificial intelligence within a trusted execution environment, simultaneously rewarding users with token-based incentives.


For this Hackathon, we have integrated Zama FHE, which developed state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technologies. We leverage framework to effortlessly craft applications with private designs utilizing homomorphic encryption. These applications, which include functionalities such as image filtering and sentiment analysis, allow users to engage without compromising data privacy.

We have developed a web3 AI application platform underpinned by the Solana blockchain, Pyth network, designed to integrate with health monitoring devices, such as a hair health IOT detector, thereby facilitating easy and convenient access to FHE AI applications for a broader user base.  In the future each instance of usage is rewarded with points, which are accrued according to the total usage, in addition to earning dividends from the treasury, thus offering users an 'AI to earn' experience with IOT detector.

### Details

## LePoker

### Description
LePoker.io is a social, competition (non-betting) poker protocol that allows players to enjoy Texas Hold’em or other poker games with their friends and communities. By introducing Verifiable Delayed Function and Zero-Knowledge Proof technology, LePoker Protocol provide multi-chain toolkits designed to facilitate the development and deployment of secure and fair games, particularly asymmetric competitive games on public blockchains. With its multi-player freeroll tournaments, seasonal ladder games, poker-to-mint, and clan matches with Web3 rewards and mechanics, LePoker brings a whole new social gaming experience to the 200 million poker players around the world.

### Details

- **Country:** Singapore
- **Additional Info:** LePoker allows anyone to create their own private game, tournament, and clans instantly or simply play ladder games with our unique multiplayer Elo matchmaking/ranking engine. It comes with verifiable delayed randomness and zero-knowledge proof of fair shuffle and secured card dealing. The full integration of IM/social platforms like Telegram/Discord mini apps provides a seamless user experience for all Web2 and Web3 users and communities. We have worked with many Web3 communities, such as Binance, Zksync, MatrixPort, BakerySwap, etc, and achieved successful results with more than 10k monthly active users. 

The solution of trapdoor-VDF combination with Zero-Knowledge Proof would greatly benefit the whole Solana ecosystem as it provide an easy way of build asymmetric or imperfect information games on Solana with unbiased delayed randomness and provable shuffle. Not like other existing web3.0 game type like AAA games, slot games or small casual games which are very difficult to find a balance between fun/achievements and money, most asymmetric games are skill based, multi-player involved, and long user life cycle combined with social relationship. Our solution would significantly help all asymmetric games like cards game, boards game, strategic game, or even RTS games to build on Solana with massive user adoption.

We got interested in the spedition industry through a common friend working in the field. We saw a niche that could be solved by a Solana program and create an interesting and practical project.

Target Audience:
We primarily target gig workers and small businesses but are available to everyone involved in the transport industry.

Objective:
We aim to meet potential clients and develop a practical solution ready to be a real competitor.

## DeAnno

### Description
DeAnno is a on-chain global gig task platform, where users can utilize their spare time to complete data annotation tasks and receive remuneration and token rewards. The tokens can be staking and dividends. In the future, it will serve as the first application of a SuperWallet for youth in the Third World.

### Details

- **Country:** China
- **Additional Info:** demo link:
https://dapp-scaffold-orcin.vercel.app/
testing instructions:
1. Home Page: There are all different tasks available. We click on the first task: Image Classification.
2. Task Introduction: After entering, we can see an introduction to the task. We choose to accept the task, and it is then added to our task list.
3. Task Page: On the task page, we can see the tasks we have accepted (some tasks are  example). We click on the first task to start working on it.
4. Task Submission: After completing the task, we click submit to submit the task. After passing the review (feature ongoing), we will receive a certain amount of tokens.
5. Profile Page: Here, we can see the rewards we have received and our personal data. By clicking on the points exchange, we can exchange tokens for an amount (stablecoin).

This process slightly deviates from our initial tokenomic design. Initially, by issuing tokens and providing a token-to-stablecoin exchange option, we effectively distribute both salary and token rewards to workers (consistent with our design), while also offering workers the choice to hold more tokens early on.

## Tagacy

### Description
Tagacy introduces a groundbreaking system that integrates Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) into everyday transactions, empowering businesses to enhance transparency, customer engagement, and value creation. By automatically minting NFTs for each transaction on platforms like WooCommerce, Tagacy revolutionizes the way businesses interact with customers, offering unique digital assets that capture the essence of every transaction.

We asked one simple question: How can we use NFTs in our daily life without a huge change management?

The answer was also a question: How about getting an NFT in return of every purchase? Food, clothing, car, house, yacht...

It's our goal at Tagacy to bring NFT usage to everyday life through customer, client, student or subscriber journey. Every transaction will give the buyer/customer a unique and non-fungible asset. It's much more valueable and easy to use then conventional invoices or receipts. Think of buying a ticket or getting a training certificate or donating money to charity organization, then getting an NFT in return. Tagacy will give this infrastructure to the businesses and intitutions.

Our target customers will be businesses as we built our income model based on transaction fee. Target audience to engage with Tagacy is the average consumer who does not have to have expertise on NFTs.


Tagacy - Revolutionizing Transactions with NFTs
In the dynamic landscape of modern commerce, differentiation and customer engagement are paramount. Tagacy introduces a groundbreaking solution by seamlessly integrating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) into everyday transactions. Through this innovative system, businesses can enhance transparency, customer engagement, and value creation.
The core concept of Tagacy revolves around automating the minting of NFTs for each transaction conducted through ecommerce platforms, ERP, invoicing and sales tools. This approach revolutionizes the way businesses interact with customers, offering them unique digital assets that encapsulate the essence of every transaction.

Key Features:
Automatic NFT Generation: Tagacy streamlines the process by automatically generating NFTs for every successful transaction, eliminating manual intervention. 
Customizable Metadata: Businesses can enrich NFTs with customized metadata, including transaction details and product descriptions, to enhance their value and authenticity. 
Blockchain Integration: Leveraging blockchain technology ensures the security, immutability, and transparency of transaction records, fostering trust between businesses and customers. 
Customer Engagement: Tagacy enhances customer engagement by providing them with unique digital assets, fostering a sense of ownership and loyalty. 
Insights: The system offers valuable analytics and insights into transactional data, empowering businesses to understand customer behavior and preferences. 

Technical Architecture:
Tagacy's technical architecture comprises several components, including:

Integration Layer: Interfaces with existing transaction platforms, such as WooCommerce, to capture transaction data.
NFT Generation Module: Automatically generates NFTs based on transaction data and customizable metadata.
Blockchain Interface: Interacts with a chosen blockchain network (e.g., Solana) to mint NFTs securely and transparently.
APIs and SDKs: Provides APIs and SDKs for easy integration with third-party systems and customization according to business needs.

Below we share Tagacy's Woocommerce developer API as a sample to demonstrate the end-to-end process. 
The merchant connects with the store URL and credentials to activate Tagacy along with crypto wallet.
 After comleting the setup, merchant can start utilizing the powerful features of Tagacy. 
Upon the successful transaction, Tagacy automatically creates NFT using merchant's wallet then transfers it to the customer's wallet.
All the required information (customer wallet address, NFT visuals, features etc) will be gathered from merchant's website and order metadata.
With the transferred NFT, the customer becomes the sole owner of the digital copy of the product or service s/he purchased. 

Use Cases:

E-commerce: Tagacy revolutionizes e-commerce transactions by providing customers with NFTs representing their purchases, enhancing authenticity and ownership.
Retail: Retail businesses can leverage Tagacy to create digital receipts in the form of NFTs, offering customers a novel and secure way to verify their purchases.
Hospitality: Hotels and restaurants can use Tagacy to create unique digital souvenirs for guests, immortalizing their experiences and fostering brand loyalty.
Authentication: Tagacy extends its utility to authentication use cases such as university diplomas and training certificates. By minting NFTs for these credentials, Tagacy ensures their authenticity, tamper-proof nature, and easy verification. This feature enhances trust and transparency in credentialing processes, mitigating the risk of fraud and counterfeit credentials.
Event Organizing: Event organizers can utilize Tagacy to issue NFT-based tickets and access passes, enhancing security and preventing ticket fraud. Attendees receive unique NFTs representing their tickets, providing a seamless and secure entry process while offering collectible memorabilia from the event.
Collectibles: Tagacy enables the creation and trading of digital collectibles, such as artwork, music, or virtual assets. Artists and content creators can mint NFTs for their creations, allowing fans and collectors to purchase, own, and trade unique digital collectibles securely on the blockchain.

Tagacy represents a paradigm shift in the way businesses interact with customers, offering a novel and innovative solution to enhance transparency, engagement, and value creation. By harnessing the power of NFTs, Tagacy empowers businesses to differentiate themselves in a competitive market landscape while providing customers with unique digital assets that capture the essence of their interactions.

## Fastmind

### Description
The AI productivity app that decentralizes accountability using voice activated smart contracts.

Imagine you’ve wanted to learn how to code but fear of failing and not knowing where to start has been holding you back.

With Fastmind, you can speak to our AIs, over the phone, tell them what your goal is, and receive a step by step plan on how to achieve them. And, along the way, our AIs hold you accountable through regular check-ins and mentoring.

Now, imagine adding another layer of motivation through community support. With Fastmind, you can raise funds for your goals from friends and family. This isn’t just about collecting money; it’s about creating a circle of people who believe in you and your aspirations.

Here’s how it works: When you set a goal, like learning to code, you can invite your network to contribute financially. These contributions are securely stored in a Solana account and are only released when your sponsors agree that you've reached a milestone. This process isn't just about the financial aspect; it's a commitment from your circle, showing they're invested in your success.

How are the funds released? Using the world's first smart contract that's executed over a phone call.

You simply tell Fastmind the progress you made, our AIs will contact your sponsors, and if they verify you achieved your goal, the funds will be released.

We've created an entirely new mechanism for interacting with the blockchain - all abstracted away behind our AIs.

Fastmind is more than a productivity tool; it's a platform that leverages AI and crypto to reinforce the human connections that help us thrive and achieve personal excellence.

## ZkoreMe

### Description
Zkore is a decentralized referral marketplace that connects and rate online product reviews across platforms, empowering consumers to make informed major purchasing decisions while incentivizing brands and reviewers to participate in a transparent, trustworthy ecosystem. By addressing the challenges faced by both shoppers and merchants, ZkoreMe aims to redefine the dynamics of e-commerce and product discovery.

### Details

- **Country:** Mexico
- **Additional Info:** Website: https://www.zkore.me/

The Problem
For consumers, product research can be a time-consuming and overwhelming process, characterized by fragmented information, conflicting reviews, and the challenge of discerning genuine feedback from biased or fake reviews. This often leads to uncertainty and indecision among shoppers, as they struggle to find reliable information to make informed purchasing decisions.

For brands, the challenge lies in the increasing customer acquisition costs (CAC) associated with reaching and acquiring new customers. With traditional marketing channels becoming saturated and less effective, brands are forced to invest significant resources in acquiring customers through paid advertising and promotional efforts, often with diminishing returns as consumers become more discerning and skeptical.

The Solution
Zkore is a decentralized platform that connects and evaluates the quality of multiple reviews across different e-commerce platforms, bringing a one-stop solution to the fragmented landscape of online product research. Zkore incentivizes reviewers by sharing part of the budget that brands are willing to pay via referrals, rewarding users who contribute high-quality, genuine feedback. This provides brands with real feedback on their products, while also offering discounted prices for their brand ambassadors and reviewers.

Value Proposition and Differentiation
Zkore captures value through a transaction-based revenue model and ad services for brands, including advanced analytics and targeted marketing tools. Unlike traditional review platforms, Zkore's decentralized approach ensures authenticity and rewards genuine contributions, setting a new standard for transparency and trust in online shopping.

Conclusion
By addressing the critical pain points for both consumers and brands, Zkore is poised to redefine the dynamics of online product research and marketing, fostering a more honest, efficient, and mutually beneficial e-commerce ecosystem.

## Hi!

### Description
Hello, my name is Ivan!
I am the Founder of the Hi! Project.

Project goal: To unite people from the Solana Community, as well as attract new users to projects on the Solana blockchain.
Project idea:

1. Attract people from other ecosystems to the Solana community through the Hi! Mobile app.
2. Create an additional filter for receiving a drop from the project (or it can be a multiplier).
3. Notify users about crypto events from Solana, or about other events (promotional posts). (both online and offline)

The idea is built on the daily routine of every person, Good morning and Good night.

In the cryptosphere, this is the most relevant, because some users in chats, apart from "Gm, Gn, Hi" do not write anything else. From this comes the main idea - to give users the opportunity to receive rewards or additional bonuses from ecosystem projects thanks to such simple things.

The mobile application can become one of the criteria, or a multiplier for receiving a drop from projects in the Solana ecosystem.

## Tang Talk

### Description
The spark that ignited TangTalk blazed to life on February 4th, 2024. In that moment of inspiration, a vision for a radically different NFT landscape took shape—one where digital assets would leap from the static to the dynamic, engaging users in a whole new way. Just three days later, on February 7th, we unveiled our proof of concept/MVP to a vibrant community of like-minded builders. The response was electric. Our project resonated deeply, capturing the imagination of our community as the dream of interactive NFT experiences took flight.

Embark on a thrilling journey with TangTalk, where static digital assets are reimagined into dynamic, interactive experiences. This isn’t just a vision—it’s a reality, brought to life by the team at TangTalk, who are reshaping the digital realm. Imagine NFTs that go beyond mere visuals to offer immersive, engaging interactions that pull you into a vibrant digital world.

At the heart of this digital metamorphosis is TangTalk, a platform that’s transcending traditional boundaries. Here, we’re not just redefining digital assets; we’re revolutionizing the way users connect. Starting with a simple yet innovative concept—a pager-style party chat NFT—we've evolved, driven by the imagination and support of a visionary community, into a dynamic, interactive platform that challenges the status quo.

Our journey has been marked by significant milestones, including successful launches on both PulseChain (PLS) and Chia, demonstrating our commitment to cross-chain functionality and the robustness of our underlying technology. Through these achievements, we've not only showcased the potential for NFTs to offer more than static art but also proven the viability of our decentralized, peer-to-peer network and the innovative L2 Cache system. This technology ensures seamless interactions and sets the foundation for future digital explorations.

As we venture further, expanding TangTalk’s capabilities to include gaming, integrated exchanges, and community-driven projects, we continue to solidify our position at the forefront of the interactive digital landscape. Our current presence on PLS and Chia, coupled with successful demonstrations of our tech and principles, paves the way for an ambitious future where blockchain communities are interconnected, and digital assets become gateways to unparalleled interactive experiences.

Select us as the hackathon winners and witness the innovative expansion of our cross-chain communication NFT DApp to Solana. Join us in revolutionizing decentralized communication on the Solana blockchain. Together, let's shape the future of blockchain technology!

## Carrot

### Description
https://www.deficarrot.com/

Liquid Yield Tokens, a single token entry to an automated, optimized yield aggregator service — it constantly monitors and reposition the pool of capital for the best available yield, which then accrues back to the token, increasing its value so you can track performance right from your wallet of choice

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** Passively holding crypto assets in your wallet is a losing game over time. Losing out on the available yield in the DeFi ecosystem is essentially a tax on your inactivity. However, navigating the various DeFi protocols that offer yield opportunities brings added risks. Not only do we aim to solve this for consumers by providing a simple single entry point, we also are capitalizing the desire to view asset values from the wallet rather than connecting to a dApp.

The Film Token project includes a strong IRL focus, very much along the lines of Superteam meets Film. We are already in talks with a number of government bodies across a few regions to establish the Film Token Hubs - in partnership with these bodies.

With the integration of film and Web3 technology, we believe that Film Token has the potential to become the next unicorn in the industry. Coupled with a dynamic slate of Film & Television projects, content that both inspires and entertains a global audience, we're confident in the platform's ability to captivate viewers worldwide.

## Mocha

### Description
Welcome to Mocha, a pioneering financial service crafted for the African continent. Mocha breaks down the barriers of traditional financial services, offering a simple, instant, and efficient way to send and receive money cross border.

### Details

- **Country:** Sierra Leone
- **Additional Info:** The Team:
Colin - Worked in the Developer Relations team at Solana Foundation for 18 months.
Cyril - Student at University of Sierra Leone, leading the Business Development efforts

Why Mocha Stands Out:

Financial Inclusion: Many Africans need access to conventional banking, Mocha opens the door to financial services for everyone directly on WhatsApp, a platform they already use daily.

Instant and Free: Forget about traditional remittance services' hefty fees and delays. Mocha ensures your transactions are instant and without any hidden costs.

More Than Just Transfers: In addition to sending and receiving money, Mocha offers virtual debit cards, interest-earning opportunities, easy WhatsApp-to-bank transfers and ease of access to the dollar.

## Ketchup Republic

### Description
Ketchup Republic is a physical space-based Web3 incentive network. Just as fragrances evoke pleasant feelings and draw people closer, each Node in Ketchup Republic acts as a 'Token Aroma Diffuser,' allowing mobile devices in the vicinity to "sense" Token Airdrops, enticing people to approach, linger, and engage. When these diffusers are interconnected, they unveil an incentive layer running parallel to the internet. For physical spaces, in addition to scents, lighting, and temperature/humidity, it introduces a Token pheromone – a new form of information stimuli.

### Details

- **Country:** Hong Kong
- **Additional Info:** Our team is transitioning from Web2 to Web3, building an incentivized network using idle devices(BlE). In Web2, we struggled to convince users to contribute their devices, but Web3's incentive mechanisms offer a promising solution. Our current product is still in the demo phase, and our Rust smart contract development is in its early stages. However, we are genuinely enthusiastic about this project's potential. By leveraging Web3's incentive levers, we believe we can successfully construct a network harnessing underutilized device resources. Although our product and skills are still maturing, we are committed to learning and iterating. This hackathon provides an excellent opportunity to advance our goals while gaining valuable experience in the Web3 space.

## Torque

### Description
Torque is an onchain offers protocol for builders to deploy marketing strategies, at scale. During Renaissance, we built a protocol, an SDK, and an offers launchpad.

Simply put, Torque allows builders to launch and manage offers that reward multiple parties, using crypto primitives. All of the offers are conditional, targeted, and have trustless onchain proofs. Torque uses a combination of derived keypairs to maintain privacy & cNFTs to track and distribute rewards.

We've interviewed hundreds of builders and realized that one of the biggest problems they had was gaining distribution and finding product market fit. With Torque, builders can find product market fit faster.

Our vision is to build Solana's onchain attention economy and revolutionize digital advertising.

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** Whitepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFQCzqaOzLMvbEBHoYcCfmAXI_QAjm4pLeDM-sthmRk/edit?usp=sharing 

BBT is a mobile-first DeFi protocol that enables anyone to invest in fractional ownership of profitable small businesses and earn passive income from real-world cash flows.

We acquire stable, cash-flowing "boring businesses" and tokenize their revenue streams, allowing global investors to buy in with as little as $50. BBT token holders receive automated quarterly distributions based on the performance of the underlying business portfolio.

By making small business investing as simple as buying tokens in an app, BBT opens up a previously inaccessible asset class to the masses. We're building the consumer-friendly gateway for investors to diversify into real-world private equity, directly from their mobile wallet.

Built on Solana, BBT is leveraging the speed and efficiency of crypto rails to disrupt traditional finance and unlock a multi-trillion dollar market. Join us in reimagining small business investing for all.

There’s a $ 1 billion hardware crypto wallet market thatruns on glorified USB-sticks. We intent to disrupt it. SPL Cards are metal card wallets that provide convenience and security for keeping funds safe. Safe self-custody of crypto assets, with great UX and gorgeous design.  

Next to the revamped SPL Cards, we are submitting a new Android Native app and the Wallet Policy program. The Wallet Policy program allows user to set wallet policies. Like a daily spending limit, a spending window (e.g. only transact during office hours), 2FA for transfers and more.  The wallet policies work with any wallet and are not tied to just the SPL Cards, no set-up from wallets or dapps required. It's all non-custodial and on-chain, enabled by Token Extensions. SPL Cards & the Wallet Policy program.

## LivingIP

### Description
LivingIP aims to revolutionize governance within DAOs and network states by introducing Living Constitutions, dynamic documents that all members can directly edit and vote on, facilitating real-time updates and democratic decision-making processes. This innovative approach ensures adaptability and continuous improvement, aligning with the decentralized ethos of web3 communities.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** As I have been building LivingIP for 6+ months my submission includes code created outside of the hackathon window. I emailed hello@colosseum.org requesting permission to use this code. After receiving feedback from Hyperdrive on the need for ecosystem integrations and clients, we've successfully onboarded several companies, including Claynosaurz. LivingIP has been entirely bootstrapped to date and are now gearing up for our pre-seed fundraising round which we expect to close in the next few months.

Our hackathon entry incorporates significant product developments made during the Renaissance hackathon. We believe that participating in Colosseum's accelerator program would significantly boost our go-to-market strategy, contributing a valuable, collaborative IP creation protocol to the Solana ecosystem. for more on how LivingIP can benefit the solana ecosystem please read this blog post which lays out the value proposition for a web3 wikipedia built on Solana: https://medium.com/@m3taversal/forging-decentralized-knowledge-every-revolution-needs-a-spark-59b8c80c1db6

## SCA: Solana Commerce Application

### Description
The Solana Commerce Application is a tool to improve the security of physical item transactions in the second-hand marketplace. Online trading of computers, cellphones, cameras, etc is prone to scams and other problems, and online marketplaces don't really address this issue, viewing their business mainly as a directory. SCA leverages Solana to record the details of a sale via a smart contract, and involves community volunteers, paid or not, to oversee the online, remote transactions.

### Details

- **Country:** Mexico
- **Additional Info:** The 1st version of this product is complete, though it only includes command line tools. Depending on how the seed funding goes, I might need to close-source subsequent versions. However, I can share some ideas about the future roadmap:

- Easy to use web dapp, potentially with the company paying users Solana fees and rent.
- Ratings for all users of the system
- Strictly enforced rules on the process and information requirements for each sale.
- Clear and public arbitration resolution rules, potentially including blind voting, and arbiter staking similar to the consensus mechanism
- Clear participant identities.
- Arbiters fees, since currently is a completely voluntary participation.
- Oracles to track delivery companies and other external tools to improve security

## MMOSH: The Connected Crypto Communities Protocol

### Description
MMOSH = Massively Multiplayer On-chain Shared Hallucination

MMOSH is a Solana protocol for creating and joining connected crypto communities mediated by AI. 

The protocol handles personal identity, attribution for the distribution of royalties and other incentives, access to token-gated communities, and the management of bonding curves and liquidity pools for creating and swapping community coins. This is done through four token primitives.

There are four contextual roles in every transaction, the ecosystem, the creator, agents and enjoyers. Most users will take on different roles in each transaction, with the exception of the ecosystem.

Nothing in the protocol is wallet-bound. Tokens can be moved from wallet to wallet. Royalties follow the tokens, not a fixed wallet address.

Our key technology is a way of "imprinting" tokens with data from other tokens at the time of minting.

The primary initial user interface is Telegram. Users can send tokens, mint, swap etc. by communicating in plain language with an AI bot. The AI bot also administers Telegram groups for new on-chain dynamics.

Users can receive their private key through a Telegram mini-app, import it into a separate standalone wallet (such as Phantom, Solflare or backpack) and connect to our web app. With the web app, the user can retrieve all tokens, all the media shared in a token-gated group and receive summaries of group conversations from the AI bot even if they lose their Telegram account.

This allows us to leverage a powerful, though centralized, group messaging system without compromising censorship resistance, composability or permissionlessness.

### Details

Our AI Telegram Bot: https://t.me/MMOSHBot?start=1294956737
Our Web App: https://mmosh.app/ and https://forge.mmosh.app/

## Skillcoin

### Description
We were considering creating a website where individuals could exchange their skills for digital currencies such as Solana. It wouldn't just be a platform for swapping skills; it would also serve as a tool to introduce more people to the concept and usage of cryptocurrencies.

Picture a straightforward website where you can showcase your talents, whether it's graphic design, writing, coding, or any other skill, and receive payment in digital currencies. It would function as a welcoming community where members support each other.

In addition to offering your own skills, this platform would also enable users to post jobs they need assistance with. Whether you're a business owner seeking a logo designer or a writer in need of editing support, you could simply describe your project and budget, allowing skilled freelancers to connect with you. This feature would streamline the process of finding help for tasks of any size, creating a convenient marketplace where individuals and businesses can easily collaborate with professionals across various fields. With the added benefit of cryptocurrency payments, transactions would be faster, more secure, and accessible to all parties involved.

Moreover, using digital currencies streamlines the process of paying for and receiving payment for small tasks, making freelance work more accessible and efficient. This platform could simplify the freelance experience and encourage more people to participate, regardless of their familiarity with cryptocurrencies.

### Details

- **Country:** Poland
- **Additional Info:** We hope you liked our presentation video. We've invested a lot of effort and passion into this project and firmly belive that it has big market potential. We're eagerly awaiting your feedback. Participating in this competition has been a pleasure, and we're grateful for the opportunity it has provided. Thank you!

## Looop Mobile Dapp

### Description
LOOOP: Revolutionizing music distribution on Web3 - Earn, Connect, and Stand Out with Subscription-based payments and Exclusive Dynamic NFT Certificates!, that give fans a more unique value.

### Details

- **Country:** Nigeria

Loop is not just another content sharing platform; it's a groundbreaking mobile app built with Bare React Native , redefining the way creators monetize their talents and engage with their audience. With Loop, creators have the power to showcase their content and earn revenue through innovative payment systems tailored to their needs.

The digital content landscape is plagued by centralization, unfair compensation models, and limited engagement opportunities for creators and audiences alike. Loop is a decentralized platform that seeks to disrupt this paradigm by offering content creators and consumers a transparent, rewarding, and engaging ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain technology and innovative tokenomics, Loop aims to revolutionize how we interact with digital content.

We understand the importance of providing creators with flexible and sustainable payment options.

## Solana Guess - The First Product Released By Litverse AI

### Description
Solana Guess is a word guessing game powered by a custom-built Solana program. It is inspired by the viral game Wordle and will allow players the ability to create a player profile, join the game and deposit SOL into a game vault that whoever wins will claim 95% of. 5% goes to a dedicated creator vault that will be used for Litverse AI daily operations which includes, hiring more members of the team and releasing bigger and better products in the near future.

Solana Guess solves the problem of the lack of LLM usage with the blockchain on top of the lack of mass virality of web3 games. A simple game that allows a user to connect their wallet, create a profile and deposit SOL in order to Play-to-Win hundreds, if not thousands of dollars by simply guessing the correct word through interacting with an AI model is bound to be successful because it's simple and easy. There will be a social share button where winners will be able to post to Facebook and X to encourage others to join in on the fun. Wordle, at its height, had millions of active users. Solana Guess isn't vaporware, it exists on devnet right now and simply needs a push over the edge and the rest will be history.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** Solana Guess is in development on devnet by a solo developer named Brian Lewis (myself). I used to be employed by Automata Inc, the game studio behind Star Atlas and I worked there for a year and a half. Previously, I was a freelance web developer and have a total of 3 years of experience. I am looking to expand the team and add more developers to the project to get it over the hump, polish the website, and squash any remaining bugs. 

Solana Guess is a word guessing game powered by Anchor that has viral potential due to its low barrier of entry and simple game loop. It's easy to sell and will be incorporated into the overall lore of the Firebirds token. Users need a simple game that will be quick and fun to play on all devices. Solana Guess is a winner and a good investment into the future of web3 gaming.

I encourage you to play around with the game in its current state. I'm putting it out there knowing that there are bugs, but I want you all to see that this is not vaporware. I also would love it if you could check out the business plan I designed for this submission. It goes into more detail than I went into in either video. Lastly, the demo is also linked below.

Thank you and have a nice day!

## Bright Sight Optimistic Oracle

### Description
An optimistic oracle allows any protocol/program to tap into any non-conventional off-chain data. It allows anyone to request data, anyone to provide that data and any program to integrate that data on-chain. The oracle optimistically assumes the data is correct as long as it isn't disputed during a dispute window. This allows for various use cases including but not limited to insurance, commodities, RWAs and in our demo - prediction markets!

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** We built/are building Hedgehog Markets (first prediction markets on Solana) and this was an area of infrastructure not available. We hope this oracle can be broadly adopted and that others will contribute to the code as well to help build out use cases of this oracle for use cases around RWAs, DePIN or other means that want to access certain data on-chain. Our prediction markets are live at hedgehog.markets and we plan to continue integrating this oracle as the resolver for all market types we offer.

## Utilink

### Description
Utilink is entering the web3 game to disrupt the centralized services market for training AI models by providing a blockchain-enabled platform for distributed training and decentralized delivery of machine learning models.

At current our system design is underway incorporating advanced cryptographic techniques, secure p2p data sharing, and federated machine learning technology.

Leveraging the speed of the Solana network as well as the integrity of zero-knowledge proofs, Utilink will enable verification of training results without revealing the underlying data to coordinate between different participants in the ecosystem.

### Details

- **Country:** Bulgaria
- **Additional Info:** BUSINESS PLAN (short):

The AI market is experiencing exponential growth, with increasing demand for AI solutions across various industries and applications. Traditional AI development and training processes are often centralized, costly, and lack transparency. By offering a decentralized solution, we aim to tap into this expanding market, catering to businesses and individuals seeking efficient and affordable AI services.
We will adopt a token-based economy, where Job Providers will purchase our native cryptocurrency tokens to access services and compensate Workers for completing tasks. Job providers seeking AI solutions will acquire our tokens from exchanges or directly from our dApp. Workers contributing computing resources for model training will receive tokens as rewards, incentivizing participation in the network.


Tokenomics
Utilink (ULNK) is a utility token designed to facilitate transactions and interactions within our decentralized AI platform. The tokenomics are carefully crafted to ensure the efficient functioning of the ecosystem, incentivize active participation, and capture and retain value over time.

Token Name: Utilink (ULNK) 
Initial Token Supply: 100M

Token Allocation:
Public Sale: 40%
Private Sale: 20% 
Strategic Partnerships: 10%
Community Rewards and Airdrops: 5% 
Team and Advisors: 15%
Liquidity Pool for staking: 10%

Token Utility:
Access to platform services: ULNK serves as the primary utility token within the platform, enabling access to various services such as model creation, training, deployment, and premium features.
Transaction fees: Job providers purchase ULNK to compensate Workers. A portion of ULNK spent on transactions within the platform is collected as transaction fees, contributing to the sustainability of the ecosystem.
Worker compensation: Workers will receive tokens as rewards for their participation in the training process. The number of tokens earned will be proportional to the computing resources contributed and the quality of their contributions, incentivizing active involvement and ensuring the reliability of the network. Workers are compensated only after the job is fully completed and verified.
Staking: Job Providers can stake ULNK to gain access to premium features, participate in network governance, and potentially receive staking rewards.
Governance and voting: Job Providers & Workers will receive additional voting rights proportional to their ULNK holdings, allowing them to participate in important decisions regarding platform upgrades, protocol changes, and community initiatives. 

Mechanisms for capturing and retaining value over time:
Scarcity: 1% of every transaction fee Utilink collects will be burned, creating scarcity and potential value appreciation over time.
Staking rewards: Users who stake ULNK will receive staking rewards in the form of additional tokens, incentivizing long-term token holding and contributing to scarcity.
Utility and demand: As the platform attracts more users and usage increases, demand for ULNK to access platform services, compensate workers, and participate in governance activities is expected to grow, contributing to the token value.

Utilink’s tokenomics are designed to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem where tokens play a crucial role in facilitating transactions, incentivizing participation, and capturing value. Through careful distribution, utility, circulation mechanisms, and mechanisms for capturing and retaining value over time, Utilink aims to drive the growth and success of our decentralized AI platform while creating value for token holders and stakeholders.


Revenue streams

Main revenue stream: Transaction Fees
4% of the tokens spent on transactions within the platform will be collected as transaction fees. These fees will contribute to the sustainability of the ecosystem, covering operational expenses such as platform maintenance, development costs, and marketing efforts.

Revenue stream II: Uploading & storing models
The user uploads the model and specifies the price in tokens for downloading. Utilink applies a 1% fee per download. To incentivize users to upload models to our dApp, we can give them access to the staking features.

Revenue stream III: Staking Mechanism
Revenue from this stream can be generated through various channels, including token sales for staking purposes, transaction fees associated with staking and un-staking activities, and potential partnerships with Solana ecosystem projects.


Marketing and Growth Strategy

Through strategic partnerships and community engagement initiatives, we aim to establish credibility, foster growth, and drive adoption. With a focus on long-term sustainability and value creation, our business model is designed to adapt and thrive in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and blockchain technology.

Social Media Engagement: We will actively engage with the AI and machine learning community on platforms, such as Twitter, Telegram, Reddit & Discord, by sharing relevant content, participating in discussions, and responding to user inquiries. 
Partnerships:
Forge strategic partnerships with AI research institutions, universities, tech companies, and industry associations to expand Utilink’s reach and credibility. Collaborating with renowned institutions and industry leaders will provide access to cutting-edge research, expertise, and distribution channels. Additionally, partnerships with blockchain projects and complementary platforms can facilitate cross-promotion, integration, and ecosystem growth, driving user adoption and community engagement. Establishing relationships with influencers and promoters in the AI and blockchain space will amplify Utilink’s messaging, increase brand awareness, and attract attention from key stakeholders, further solidifying its position as a trusted innovator in the AI industry.
Community Engagement:
Build and nurture an active and vibrant community around Utilink through dedicated forums, channels, groups, and social media communities. By creating inclusive spaces for users to connect, collaborate, and share knowledge, Utilink can foster a sense of belonging and ownership among its community members. Hosting virtual meetups, webinars, and online sessions will enable direct engagement with the community, providing opportunities to share updates, gather feedback, and strengthen relationships. Additionally, through referral campaigns, community rewards, and airdrops, we will incentivize participation and contributions, driving user engagement and growth organically while building a loyal and supportive user base for Utilink’s ecosystem.


Operations and Governance

Our organizational structure consists of a core team of experienced professionals, supported by advisors and strategic partners with expertise in AI, blockchain, and business development. Decentralized governance mechanisms enable community involvement in decision-making processes, including protocol upgrades, token management, and ecosystem development.

Operational processes for token issuance, management, and maintenance are automated through smart contracts and decentralized applications. Regular audits and security assessments ensure the integrity and reliability of our platform. Continuous improvement and feedback mechanisms drive innovation and enhance user experience.


Risk Management

Technological Risks:
* Vulnerabilities in smart contracts, decentralized applications, and blockchain protocols lead to security breaches, hacks, or exploits.
* Compatibility issues with third-party integrations, software dependencies, and interoperability challenges with other blockchain platforms.
Mitigation Strategies:
* Conduct comprehensive security audits and penetration testing of smart contracts, platform codebase, and infrastructure to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* Implement multi-layered security measures, including encryption, access controls, and bug bounty programs, to protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access.
* Continuously monitor network performance, scalability metrics, and user feedback to identify and address technical issues in a timely manner.
* Foster collaboration with blockchain developers, security experts, and open-source communities to leverage best practices, share knowledge, and contribute to the improvement of blockchain technology.

By proactively identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies, we can enhance the resilience, security, and success of our decentralized AI platform token project. By addressing regulatory, technological, market, and operational risks, we can build confidence among investors, users, and stakeholders and create a robust foundation for long-term growth and sustainability.


Financial Projections 

Many users are recognizing the potential benefits of incorporating machine learning models into their workflows. Consequently, the demand for model training services is skyrocketing.
We are estimating that with an actively engaged community and thoughtful marketing, we should have a constant supply of jobs to create opportunities for our workers. We are expecting that by the end of Q1, we will be able to support 1,400 workers and close to 5,000 by the end of Y1, experiencing a 50% growth rate quarter to quarter. After the first year, we are projecting a steady 30% growth rate quarter to quarter based on the compound annual growth rate predicted for the machine learning industry, resulting in close to 14,000 workers at the end of Y2. By the end of Y3, we are expecting to have accumulated a base of 40,000 workers, propelling us towards exponential expansion.

Initially, we are anticipating our profit margin to be at 25%, but once we have established our operational framework and our strategic marketing activities have generated positive results, we expect that margin to grow further.

## dropAR

### Description
Imagine NFT drops that look as if game characters, weapons and other loot really drop from the sky right in your street.  

dropAR is a tool for web3 game developers, NFT creators and coin communities. 
dropAR allows them to literally drop loot and other awards in the real world in AR – so then anyone can collect and claim the awards, NFTs or coins by reaching those digital assets’ locations in the real world.
Anyone can use dropAR to “drop” any web3 asset anywhere in the world. Just log in, provide the asset, prove your ownership of it and choose when and where in the world it becomes visible. Anyone can download the dropAR app, follow the drops announcement and choose which drop they want to try and grab. When an NFT or coins get dropped – the players can use the app’s map, navigate the world and reach the reward before anyone else. If successful - they claim it to their wallet.
The real fun is that the rewards can take any shape and size. A giant loot box in the middle of Times Square, a rare monster sticking its head through the portal in the middle of Eiffel tower, a row of shiny coins down the Piccadilly street – sky isn’t even the limit, because the sky above Shibuya Junction is a great place to put an entire NFT collection. 

All the materials for submission, including Web3 part of dev repo from keepsake and forwARdgame can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GdSJjHk8VVKKEt9TZzYBtohYYFCGngqs?usp=sharing

### Details

- **Country:** Germany
- **Additional Info:** App tech Flow:

NFT creator side:

Keepsake side:
SignUp and Login - currently Under construction, demo page available: https://dropar.keepsake.gg (devnet)

Connect your wallet to the site, enter how many tokens you want to mint, an image, a name and a description. Optionally you can add metadata of any kind. Once you’ve minted tokens you are given the mint address and the ability to withdraw the tokens.

Tokens are minted through the standard solana libraries (spl-token, spl-token-metadata) using the TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM token standard. Tokens are minted to a simple vault program, where they can later be withdrawn. (Later versions will let developers set up conditions for withdrawing tokens, all controlled by an API that will sign vault transactions)

forwARdgame side
Open the map https://keepsake-map.vercel.app/  (if not redirected automatically) and select a location for the drop, select from your assets, and amount ->  confirm the drop
For Webapp we used svelte and openlayers

Once the creator mints a token on dropar.keepsake.gg our API gets notified of the new token (address, amount, some metadata). It is then available on https://keepsake-map.vercel.app/ for the creator to set the drop. 

End User side:
Download the app (apk), view the list of all drops (under construction), Navigate to the nearest asset and when within 5 meters - claim by opening the chest.

Location-based multiplayer shared-AR app, implements keepsake API, corresponds with forwARdgame DB, synchronizes actions and positions of multiple players over socket server, Uses Google Geospatial API for precise AR positioning and Mapbox for map UI
When a player opens a box in the DropAR app, our server sends the node data to keepsake and gets a transaction string, which is forwarded to the client, who then signs it and sends it straight to keepsake, so they can write it to the blockchain.
An ASP.Net Core API using Entity Framework to interact with our PostGIS spatial database

## Fen 

### Description
Title: Empowering Dreams: The Fen Story

Introduction:
In the bustling streets of Sierra Leone, finding a place to call home is more than just a transaction—it's a journey filled with challenges and dreams. Enter Fen, a pioneering real estate platform on a mission to revolutionize access to housing and empower individuals to fulfill their dreams of homeownership.

Identifying the Problem:
Fen's story begins with a realization: traditional real estate methods in Sierra Leone are plagued by high costs, limited transparency, and a lack of personalized assistance. The founders witnessed firsthand the frustrations faced by individuals and families as they navigated the complex and often daunting process of finding a home.

The Birth of Fen:
Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to making a difference, the founders of Fen set out to create a solution. They envisioned a platform that would leverage technology to streamline the property search process while maintaining the expertise of real estate agents. Thus, Fen was born—a beacon of hope in an otherwise challenging landscape.

The Fen Experience:
At Fen, we believe that everyone deserves access to affordable, transparent, and convenient housing options. Our platform empowers users to browse through a wide range of properties, negotiate rents directly with landlords, and even split costs with roommates—all with just a few taps on their phone.

Impact and Growth:
Since our inception, Fen has made waves in the real estate industry, garnering praise from users and investors alike. We've seen steady growth in user sign-ups and property transactions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. With strategic partnerships and collaborations, we've expanded our reach and solidified our position as a leader in the market.

The Future of Fen:
As we look to the future, Fen remains committed to our mission of empowering dreams. We're continuously innovating and adapting to meet the evolving needs of our users. With the support of investors who share our vision, we're poised to take Fen to new heights and make an even greater impact on the lives of individuals and families across Sierra Leone and beyond.

Conclusion:
In a world where finding a home can feel like an insurmountable challenge, Fen offers hope. We believe that by harnessing the power of technology and community, we can create a brighter future for all. Join us on this journey and be part of the Fen story—an inspiring tale of empowerment, innovation, and dreams realized.

## Solmusic

### Description
We are building a mobile app that allows users to stream music on solana's blockchain using our Governance Token ($SOLM).

While listening to their favorite artist, they can mine $SOLM automatically, and also be able to purchase it from the platform's native wallet if they want to buy an artist's token.

This way, they invest in their favorite artists.

They can hold it, use it to buy merch and tickets from the artist, and convert it back into $SOLM.

For instance, if a listener wanted to invest in the attention Rema is getting for his new album, they can buy $REMA using $SOLM.

Then they can use their $REMA to purchase his merch, concerts or even exchange it with other users.

If they decide to hold it instead, they can trade it for $SOLM at a higher or lower price based on market demands.

## Bliv

### Description
bliv is a permissionles yield tokenization & trading protocol where you can execute any yield strategy you want.

We make the Crypto Bond a possiblity, giving control of the future yield of a given token to the user's hands.

First, bliv tokenizes any Solana SPL token, i.e. it splits any Yield Bearing token in a Principal + Yield tokens. So you can trade the way you want.

And then our liquidity pool / Automated Market Maker is the best in class for trading yield bearing assets. You will have the best capital efficiency and almost zero risks for impermanent loss, as the traded assets are the same, just in different period of times.

By creating a yield market in Solana DeFi, bliv unlocks the full potential of yield, enabling users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:

- Fixed yield (e.g. earn fixed yield on $bSOL or $jitoSOL)

- Long yield (e.g. bet on $JLP yield going up by purchasing more yield)

- Provide liquidity with on our AMM and earn more yield without additional risks (e.g. provide liquidity on the $bSOL <> $p-bSOL market)

### Details

- **Country:** Brazil
- **Additional Info:** bliv is the missing part on the Solana DeFi puzzle.

You can lend your tokens in Kamino, you can borrow tokens on marginfi and even leverage positions in both platforms.

You can stake your SOL directly with a validator. Or even better, you can stake your SOL using a Liquid Staking protocol.

So you have all you need. You can get your Liquid Staking Token and then... what do you do with it?

What if you could have more options? Maybe you would like to make sure you get a fixed yield and go to Bahamas.

Or... You want to levarege your position and try to get more yield, points, rewards, whatever.

Your strategy can vary in bull or bears. And we're here to make it easier for you.

Using bliv, you can always maximize your will: increase yield exposure on your favorite tokens in a bull market or hedge against drawndowns in a bear.

## postgreChain

### Description
Bridging PostgreSQL with Blockchain for Web2 to Web3 Seamless Integration

### Details

- **Country:** Turkey
- **Additional Info:** Why postgreChain (pChain)?
Many startups and open-source projects use PostgreSQL, and PostgreSQL has almost become a standard in the open- source world. Therefore, PostgreSQL is a key point to start web2-web3 integration. pChain adds an abstraction to the business model layer in PostgreSQL and thereby enables interaction with Solana using PL/SQL language, which is already familiar to database administrators and developers. Thus, there is no need to deal with RPC requests as in tools like web3.js.
Advantages of pChain:
It combines web2 operations with account management, token program, NFT, and Solana Program features with just a few definitions. Processes can be managed completely at the DB level without investing in additional servers or web hosting and without going outside the existing business model.

## Castody.io

### Description
Castody.io is a pioneering web3 application that champions data security and ownership for users across the internet. Through Castody, users can seamlessly collect, encrypt, and securely store their profile data in distributed, decentralized web cloud storage systems such as SolCloud. Our mission at Castody is to empower users with full ownership over their data, granting them the autonomy to selectively share it with third-party services based on their own will or intention.

Castody serves as a vital tool for both web2 and web3 applications, enabling them to request user data while incentivizing users for their participation. This data holds immense value in terms of understanding a service's target clientele. However, it's crucial to emphasize that only users themselves are the ultimate arbiters of whether to disclose such data or not.

With Castody, we're reshaping the landscape of data management, placing control back into the hands of those who create and contribute to it – the users. Join us in our mission to revolutionize data ownership and security on the internet.

### Details

- **Country:** Spain
- **Additional Info:** Pavlo Chebotiuk (Founder, Software Engineer, linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/chebotiuk)

## Assisterr - Incentive-driven data inference framework for Community-owned AI models

### Description
Our solution is an incentive-driven framework that combines AI, Web3, and DevTooling. It can be used to incentivize the creation of community-owned AI models. For example, we use this framework to train an AI model based on community-generated content from the Solana StackExchange.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** Developers often struggle to get timely support while building and often ask questions on StackOverflow. This can be a solution, but there is a lack of incentive to provide the answers and evaluate its quality by other contributors.

Over the last year, LLMs have empowered real-time conversational chatbot support, but the problem is getting updates regularly. We aim to solve this by incentivizing regular data inference.

To tackle this challenge, we have built an incentive-driven framework that encourages the community to contribute by answering questions at the StackExchange-style interface.

Overview

Developers can pose questions on the Solana StackExchange, seeking assistance or guidance for Solana development. The Content Retriever then automatically fetches relevant data from the subforum and stores it in the Pinecone Vector Database. Developers can interact with our Backend AI, initiating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process. This involves querying the Pinecone Vector Database for similar topics and engaging with the Large Language Model (LLM), powered by Chat GPT 4, to generate comprehensive answers. As a token of appreciation for contributions, developers who provide answers on platforms like Solana StackExchange or Stack Overflow are eligible for rewards. To claim rewards, developers simply need to submit address verification by signing a message using their Solana Wallet. Anybody can ask questions, contribute answers, and claim rewards to enrich the developer's content.

Our framework consists from:

Rewarding Mechanism - We have designed a reward mechanism to incentivize valuable contributions and their validation by the community. For the Hackathon, a address verification procedure for the purpose of rewards claiming process. If a developer wants to claim rewards, he must submit a Proof of Account. That means he needs to prove that he is the owner of the StackOverlow account. That can be done by putting a code in the About section of his StackOverflow account. After that, he would need to provide his address on which rewards would be sent. To do it, he needs to pass the Proof of Wallet procedure by signing his StackOverflow user_id with his Solana Wallet.

AI Infrastructure Layer - The AI part of our solution utilizes the RAG model. Which provides efficient data inference compared to model finetuning. The retriever component is the Pinecone Vector Database, where every vector is a scraped question/answer pair from Solana StackExchange forum. Content is categorized by topic/area/programming language and inserted in a database. That also enables provable training functionality, since every vector represents a traceable content chunk. When a developer asks a question, a similarity search is performed on a vector database where question/answer semantics are taken into consideration. With the most similar answers, LLM (ChatGPT 4.0) is poked to structure a fine answer to the developer.

Leaderboard - In order to review who is the biggest contributor to Solana StackExchange, a Leaderboard has been created to review the contributions from different aspects. Those aspects include the ones who asked questions, gave answers and have had the most up votes.

I'm unsure of how to exactly say this.. 
You're going to be very uncertain of where to start. It's a huge project. 
It's also completely bootstrapped, which means that it's missing proper documentation. 
But the truth is, it can achieve what I have stated in the presentation - and with support it will be a massively powerful addition to the Solana ecosystem. 
This message is from the heart - and it's hard to fully get it across in a message like this. But this product is solid. 
If you guys interview us, David will explain it in full - and we'll come through on every claim made in the deck. 

Thank you.

## zk-Lokomotive

### Description
Zk based fully secure and trustless milultichain file transfer system.

### Details

- **Country:** Turkey
- **Additional Info:** Introduction

    This project aims to create a secure and efficient file transfer system bridging Solana and Ethereum networks by integrating ZK, IPFS, and Wormhole. ZK ensures file integrity and privacy, IPFS facilitates file storage, and Wormhole enables cross-chain token and data transfer.

This project encompasses file transfer scenarios within the Solana-Solana and Solana-EVM ecosystems.

In the Solana-Solana file transfer scenario, WebRTC is employed instead of Wormhole, with the endpoints (IDs) being the users' wallet addresses on the Solana network. Within the Solana network, the file transfer process operates as follows: RSA keys are utilized to encrypt AES keys, facilitating their secure exchange between the two clients. Subsequently, the file is encrypted using the exchanged AES key and decrypted accordingly by the recipient.

On the other hand, the architecture undergoes a significant shift for file transfer between Solana and EVM-based networks. In this scenario, I establish a bridge between Solana and EVM networks. The file is encrypted with zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and transformed into a token in exchange for tokens. This token, encapsulating the ZK proof of the file's integrity, traverses the Solana-EVM bridge via Wormhole. Upon reception, the recipient validates the ZK proof to claim the file. Additionally, I retrieve the file from IPFS, ensuring its integrity based on the verified proof.

In summary, this project implements a sophisticated file transfer mechanism, leveraging different technologies for seamless communication between Solana-Solana and Solana-EVM networks. Through meticulous encryption, tokenization, and validation processes, it ensures the secure and verifiable exchange of files while maintaining compatibility and interoperability across disparate blockchain ecosystems.
Motivation:

Providing the amount of our data continues rapidly in the technological singularity. Traditional file formats often lack adequate privacy and security, especially when it comes to sensitive data. File services run on a central server, creating the risk of data breaches and privacy violations. We offer a different solution to this than traditional breaks, by combining the powerful capacities and polynomials of mathematics and the decentralized generality of Solana, thus challenging the trilemma.
Solution:
Adopting a decentralized approach to file transfer, utilizing the principles of zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs), can significantly enhance privacy and security. This method allows for the verification of file transmission without revealing the contents of the files to the network or a third party.

Scenario Secure Research File Sharing

Scene: Biomedical Research University

Characters:

Alice: Biomedical researcher
Bob: Collaborator

Solana-Solana File Transfer:

Location: Research Lab at the Biomedical Research University

Action:

Alice prepares to share a research file with Bob securely within the Solana network.

Dialogue:

Alice: Hi Bob, I've completed the analysis on our latest research data. I need your input on it.
Bob: Sure Alice, I'm ready to collaborate. How should we proceed?
Alice: We'll transfer the file securely using Solana's network. I'll encrypt the file with RSA keys and share the AES key with you.
Bob: Sounds good. Let's get started.

Process:

Alice encrypts the research file using RSA keys and prepares to share the AES key with Bob for decryption.
Alice shares the AES key securely with Bob using their Solana wallet addresses as identifiers.
Bob receives the AES key and decrypts the file, enabling him to review the research data.

Outcome:

The research file is securely transferred from Alice to Bob within the Solana network, ensuring privacy and integrity.

Solana-EVM File Transfer:

Location: Research Lab at the Biomedical Research University

Action:

Alice needs to share a research file with collaborators on an EVM-based network.

Dialogue:

Alice: Bob, we have collaborators on an EVM-based network who need access to our research data. We'll need to transfer it securely.
Bob: Understood. How do we proceed with this transfer?
Alice: We'll use a bridge between Solana and the EVM network. I'll encrypt the file with zero-knowledge proofs and tokenize it for transfer.
Bob: Got it. Let's make sure everything is set up correctly.

Process:

Alice encrypts the research file with zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and converts it into a token for transfer.
Alice initiates the transfer of the tokenized file through the Solana-EVM bridge via Wormhole.
Collaborators on the EVM-based network receive the token and validate the ZK proof to claim the file.
Alice retrieves the file from IPFS to ensure its integrity based on the verified proof.

Outcome:

The research file is securely transferred from Alice to collaborators on the EVM-based network, maintaining privacy and integrity across different blockchain ecosystems.

Architecture
Benefits:

Privacy: ZK encryption guarantees that sensitive data can only be accessed by Alice and authorized collaborators.
Integrity: ZK proofs confirm that research data has not been altered in a secure environment.
Traceability: Solana and EVM blockchains provide a permanent record of transactions.
Trust: The protocol uses both cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to share research data in a trusted way.
Wormhole Integration: Seamless communication between Solana and Ethereum allows collaborators and stakeholders to be on different blockchains.

Enhancements

Access Control: Access permission efficiency can be increased with advanced smart contracts in Solana.
User Interface: An easy-to-use web or mobile interface to follow the entire process.
Data Analytics: Analytics operations on data stored in Ethereum & Solana.
Technical Implementation of [Solana-Solana] File Transfer:

The architecture comprises two main components: the Solana-Solana file transfer system using WebRTC and the Solana-EVM file transfer system with the bridge architecture.

Utilizes WebRTC for secure file transfer between users on the Solana network.
Encryption and decryption of files using RSA and AES keys.
Direct exchange of encrypted files between clients.

    WebRTC Configuration: Utilize the RTCPeerConnection API to configure the WebRTC connection. Include STUN/TURN servers in the configuration for NAT traversal.

    Encryption and Decryption: Use RSA keys for encryption and decryption of AES keys. Implement the exchange of AES keys between clients securely.

    Solana-EVM Bridge: Establish a bridge between Solana and EVM networks for token transfer. Implement the conversion of files into tokens with ZK proofs.

    Wormhole Integration: Utilize Wormhole for cross-chain communication between Solana and EVM networks. Transfer tokens representing ZK proofs through the Wormhole bridge.

    IPFS Integration: Retrieve files from IPFS based on the ZK proofs presented by the recipients.

## Movement

### Description
Memecoins are absolutely blowing up, but it’s too hard for most people to get started. Imagine telling your cousin to download a wallet, save their 12-word seed phrase, pay SOL fees instead of USD, have almost no way to track their portfolio, and then pay $100 for crypto tax reports at the end of the year.

That’s why today, Andrew and I are launching Movement – the Robinhood for memecoins, built on Solana. We’re building the easiest, safest, and funnest app to trade memecoins. 

Our goal is to make cultural cryptocurrencies accessible to the world, like how Coinbase made investment cryptocurrencies accessible.

## Fair Lottery

### Description
Fair Lottery is a blockchain backed lottery system with couple of twists. One of them is participants decide how much of the pool will be distributed to how many people. Another one is, participants can create their own lotteries! (Great benefit for Youtubers, influencers, and fundraisers etc.).

This is how does it work, people send solana to each lottery session to join. Along with their solana they cast a vote between 0 and 100 percent for payout ratio. Let's say on average payout ratio is decided at 20 percent, it means that randomly chosen 20 percent of the participants will receive 99 percent of the lottery pool and 1 percent goes to us. 

People will receive this prize according to their contribution. Meaning, if a ticket worth of 10 solana wins 5 solana, than a ticket worth of 20 solan wins 10 solana. 

This is all possible thanks to Solana's super fast and cost efficient infrastructure. Participants can start joining with as little as 0.50$ worth of Solana.


Thank you

## Repl

### Description
Repl is building the first unifying trust layer for DePIN networks. It activates idle assets and hardware on Solana and large-scale DePIN networks through an innovative restaking mechanism, providing a robust and mature unifying trust layer for emerging DePIN networks and related applications on Solana to better serve real users. 

Despite the promising potential of DePINs, one significant obstacle hindering their widespread adoption is the issue of trust in service quality. DePIN networks usually combine token staking and physical hardware services to form the trust layer of the network, ensuring the quality of network services. When service providers' hardware services fail to meet the network's requirements, the network penalizes the service providers' staked token. However, for an emerging DePIN network, building a trust layer is not easy, especially when their native tokens for trust layer governance are not yet issued (such as in the DePIN testnet phase), concentrated in the hands of a few service providers (when DePIN nodes are not widely distributed and diversified enough), or the value is insufficient to cover potential losses for users (when the market value of DePIN native tokens is smaller than the service value).

Repl aims to build a unifying trust layer for DePIN networks using SOL restaking. When SOL tokens are restaked on Repl, emerging DePIN networks on Solana can leverage Repl as their trust layer, providing trust for their DePIN services. Its trust layer governance and reward mechanism can be implemented using SOL. This creates stickiness for DePIN projects to keep building on Solana and enhances capital efficiency for SOL token holders.

## Written

### Description
Written is revolutionizing traditional publishing industry. We build publishing platform and a consumer app focused on ebook and audiobooks. With Written we take core problems of the industry - low revenue for content creators(from 5% to 10% only), lack of connection between author and reader, value of the ebook - and reimagine how digital should work. We build a place where an author has full freedom to monetize content and reader has direct connection to the author, can collect ebooks and even resell them.

### Details

- **Country:** Serbia
- **Additional Info:** Written is a web3 consumer app, focused on ebooks. We are to launch a consumer app for users and a self-publishing platform for content creators with a secondary marketplace for ebooks. Imagine gamification mechanics at Kindle where users are highly interested in spending inside the app to acquire content, can collect ebooks NFT’s and resell them. 

With Written we are taking core problems of the industry - low revenue for authors(from 5% to 10% only), lack of connection between author and reader, value of the book(and ebook) - and reimagine how digital should work. We believe that reading must be simple and fun, we believe incentivising readers is important, we believe content is the king. We also see that authors seeking new ways of monetisation - they want to crowdfund, make auctions, split revenue, be able to have ongoing revenue from books published. We believe that unlike in video or music industry smart contract and secondary market will work and we set it as our main goal.

## Solspro

### Description
Solspro allows users to place Multiple Limit Orders (MLO) on every collection with the same bag of cash. In addition, users can also specify attributes and rarity parameters. As the process is quite simple, the user goes to the Solspro dashboard, selects the collection, defines their purchasing zone, locks the money including any fees and the NFT has immediately sniped once it reaches the price specified by the user. Additionally, We're establishing a market dedicated exclusively to buyers, which we called the Buyers market. Furthermore, Solspro comes with a fairly new solution called Ceiling Price (CP).

## Quest Of Hat

### Description
A Solana developer is struggling to compile the code... Out of the blue, he is offered to enter the cyberspace to look for the hat, which will unlock his hidden potential. 

The goal of the game is to collect 4 hat fragments and combine them into a hat. Made in collaboration with DevWifHat project, each attempt costs from $DWH, and winners receive great token prizes. Additionally, players may encounter partner memecoin drops along the way.

Each move drains energy, so the dev needs to think about the right moves to make, gathering drinks, snacks and touching grass to restore it along his quest.

This is the first game created using Solana SDK on Godot open source game engine, marking the start of a brand new web3 game era!

## Valocracy-SOL

### Description
Valocracy-SOL is a novel framework for user-first and ecosystem-driven Web3 communities that fairly aggregates and distributes value. It aims to tackle current issues with on-chain coordination that are observed in DAO's, which are failing to proper escalate and innovate on web3 truly ideals.

We are proposing a Solana-based implementation of a theorical protocol designed by Rafael Castaneda (@castacrypto), a professor with a Masters in software engineering, blockchain analyst, and community builder in Brazil.

In this implementation we want to experiment and showcase not only Solana's low fees and fast-finality, but also emerging technologies such as compressed NFT's, token 2022 and vaults, and how these technologies can be used to leverage scalable and well organized web 3 communities as the foundation for future digital societies, in the likes of portraied by Balaji's Network State theory.

More details about Valocracy can be found on it's manifesto at https://valocracy.xyz.

### Details

- **Country:** Brazil
- **Additional Info:** We opted for providing a slide deck instead of a pitch video because we work with a dense theoretical framework that is simply impossible to be described under 3 minutes. 

In Valocracy we are not merely tokenizing something that already exists, we are trying to redevelop socio-economical primitives for on-chain human coordination. We know that something like this may be overwhelming for a 3-min pitch or for a hackaton, but nonetheless, we are doing our best to remain true to our mission and objectives.

The theorical framework is already under development for months now, and our contribution in this specific hackaton is to demonstrate that a Solana implementation is not only possible, but also that Solana may be the best choice for future valocracies that aim to scale and coordinate thousands ou millions of individuals.

## Antelao AI (formerly StorX.ai)

### Description
Antelao AI is building the asset layer for generative AI.

We believe that the advancement of generative AI is creating a novel category of AI assets. This includes LLM chatbots, characters, agents, customized image generative models, customized video generative models, customized music genarative models, etc. These assets stand apart from traditional AI models primarily because foundation models have significantly reduced the barriers to entry for creating them. We foresee a near future where individuals will be able to craft customized AI applications by simply providing text instructions, possibly along with examples of songs, images, or videos. These applications will cater to specific needs, such as enabling customers to hear a renowned singer perform any song of their choice.

These assets hold value for a variety of reasons. For instance, assets like LLM therapists and virtual travel agents generate direct value for the end consumer by providing personalized services. Meanwhile, the worth of some content-generative models is anchored in the value of the content they produce. For example, the value of an image-generative model tailored for a particular NFT collection is supported by the inherent value of that NFT collection. Additionally, these assets can derive significant value from intellectual property rights.

We have very strong AI capability. We have developed our own Large Language Models (LLMs), text-to-image, and text-to-game generative models. Our proprietary data significantly enhances our models' performance in specific vertical domains. Additionally, our middle layer technology for LLM assistants surpasses open-source implementations and is on par with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Traditionally, these envelopes are filled with money and given during holidays and family gatherings to convey good wishes and luck. In this hackathon, the task is to innovate on this tradition by creating a digital platform where users can send and receive virtual red envelopes, incorporating features like random amounts of money, social networking elements, and the integration of secure digital payment methods. The platform should not only mimic the physical act of giving and receiving red envelopes but also enhance user engagement through gamification, social interaction, and a seamless financial transaction process.

## Assisterr - Incentive Driven Models

### Description
Our solution is a incentive-driven framework that lays at the intersection of AI, Web3, and DevTooling and can be used to incentivize the creation of community-owned AI models.

To tackle this challenge, we have built an incentive-driven framework that encourages the community to contribute by answering questions at the StackExchange-style interface.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** Developers often struggle to get timely support while building and often ask questions on StackOverflow. This can be a solution, but there is a lack of incentive to provide the answers and evaluate its quality by other contributors.

Over the last year, LLMs have empowered real-time conversational chatbot support, but the problem is getting updates regularly. We aim to solve this by incentivizing regular data inference.

Our solution is a incentive-driven framework that lays at the intersection of AI, Web3, and DevTooling and can be used to incentivize the creation of community-owned AI models.

To tackle this challenge, we have built an incentive-driven framework that encourages the community to contribute by answering questions at the StackExchange-style interface.

There are 3 components in our solution:

Rewarding Mechanism - We have designed a reward mechanism to incentivize valuable contributions and their validation by the community. For the Hackathon, a address verification procedure for the purpose of rewards claiming process. If a developer wants to claim rewards, he must submit a Proof of Account. That means he needs to prove that he is the owner of the StackOverlow account. That can be done by putting a code in the About section of his StackOverflow account. After that, he would need to provide his address on which rewards would be sent. To do it, he needs to pass the Proof of Wallet procedure by signing (do sign) his StackOverflow user_id with his Solana Wallet. 

AI Infra Layer - The AI part of our solution utilizes the RAG model. Which provides efficient data inference compared to model finetuning. The retriever component is the Pinecone Vector Database, where every vector is a scraped question/answer pair from StackOverflow's "near protocol" tag. Content is categorized by topic/area/programming language and inserted in a database. That also enables provable training functionality, since every vector represents a traceable content chunk. When a developer asks a question, a similarity search is performed on a vector database where question/answer semantics are taken into consideration. With the most similar answers, LLM (ChatGPT 4.0) is poked to structure a fine answer to the developer.

Leaderboard - In order to review who is the biggest contributor to Solana StackExchange, a Leaderboard has been created to review the contributions from different aspects. Those aspects include the ones who asked questions, gave answers and have had the most up votes.

## ReliefLink

### Description
ReliefLink: A blockchain-powered crowdfunding platform dedicated to supporting war-torn regions and refugees

Problem Addressed:

In regions devastated by war and conflict, traditional methods of aid distribution often face significant challenges. Limited access to banking services, lack of transparency, and risks of fraud undermine relief efforts, leaving affected populations without crucial support. ReliefLink steps in to address these issues head-on.

Solution Offered:

Supporting War-Torn Regions: ReliefLink serves as a dedicated crowdfunding platform, allowing users to directly contribute to campaigns aimed at assisting war-affected populations and refugees. By facilitating targeted donations, ReliefLink enables individuals to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those in need.

Enhanced Transparency: The platform ensures complete transparency by leveraging blockchain technology to display the transaction history of campaign wallet addresses. Contributors can track their donations every step of the way, fostering trust and accountability in the relief process.

Seamless and Secure Transactions: Operating even in the most challenging conditions, ReliefLink is designed to process transactions reliably, even during communication disruptions and power outages. By providing a seamless and secure channel for donations, the platform empowers users to support relief efforts with confidence.

Automated Validation: ReliefLink utilizes smart contracts to automate transaction validation, ensuring that funds reach their intended recipients swiftly and securely. This minimizes the risk of fraud and misappropriation, safeguarding donations and maximizing their impact on the ground.

Media Storage: To preserve crucial documentation and aid efforts, ReliefLink stores all photos on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), distributing files across a network of nodes. This decentralized approach reduces the risk of data loss due to a single point of failure, particularly vital in conflict zones.

## Solana Matcher 

### Description
There's a surge in interest among businesses and founders looking to build on Solana's infrastructure. However, navigating the landscape to find the right team for specific projects isn't always straightforward - especially for newcomers. Recognizing this challenge, we're excited to build Solana Matcher—a on-chain digital personas, hiring and leads generation platform tailored for the Solana Community.

Solana Matcher is designed to empower the Solana community by providing a solution for connecting businesses, founders, developers and community members. Users can easily connect their various social media profiles (linkedin, wallets,  X, github, discord, blogs and more) and upload resumes.

Here's how it works: Anyone interested in building on Solana can utilize Solana Matcher platform to describe their business needs and project requirements just pasting the description into our UI. Our LLM-powered system then goes to work, matching the best teams based on skillsets, experience, and project fit. From there, we facilitate connections and collaboration, ensuring that every project gets the right team to bring it to life. Additionally, Solana Matcher serves as a lead generation platform, connecting businesses with top-tier talent and vice versa, thus fostering long-term relationships beyond just hiring needs.

Solana Matcher incentivizes Solana Community members to participate actively in the platform by rewarding them with a portion of the pool for connecting their social media profiles and uploading their current resumes. This process is integrated into the platform's architecture, with smart contracts on the Solana automatically allocating rewards to users based on their contributions.

Furthermore, Solana Matcher employs a payment model for business owners seeking to be matched with the best Solana community members. Instead of introducing its own token, Solana Matcher operates exclusively in SOL. Business owners make matching requests by paying in SOL directly to the platform. These SOL payments are then directed to the Treasury, a designated smart contract.

The Treasury serves as a communal fund where all SOL payments from matching requests are collected. Periodically, the Treasury distributes these accumulated funds among users who have shared their achievements within the Solana ecosystem. We want to introduce a share-to-earn SoFi model. This distribution is executed programmatically via smart contracts. 

Solana Matcher also offers a range of features to enhance the user experience:

Track Matches, Applications, Interactions:

Dive into your personalized dashboard for a comprehensive view of your Solana projects hunting journey. Monitor the number of job matches, keep tabs on your applications, and see how many recruiters have engaged with your AI-powered persona.

No more CV updates:

Solana Matcher Social Media Profile sync feature keeps your resume fresh and up-to-date. We automatically fetch your most recent achievements, accolades, and professional updates from your social media profiles, ensuring your CV is consistently updated. This means that even if you're not actively looking for a Solana project, your newly acquired skills can potentially match you with better opportunities.

Engage with Candidate’s AI PERSONA Before the 1:1:

For business owners: Get a sneak peek into potential candidates' profiles before scheduling a call. Explore their skills, experience, and achievement. Interact with their AI persona to gain insights and assess compatibility before diving into a one-on-one conversation.

### Details

- **Country:** Poland
- **Additional Info:** Amid a landscape dominated by corporate uniformity, thePolacy Devs emerges as a beacon of innovation. Our small but formidable team of developers and hackers challenges the status quo, creating web3 and AI solutions extremely fast. Our work is not just about building applications; it's about crafting digital masterpieces that set us apart from the mainstream software giants. More about us: https://devs.thepolacy.pl/

We are the architects of the top Polish NFT Collection, supported by a vibrant and expansive community. Our X - https://twitter.com/thepolacy_?s=21&t=i3BjJJ-UDV2f-A0MtCgryg

We envision the Solana Matcher as the gateway for businesses worldwide to launch their next groundbreaking projects on Solana. Our business model secures a portion of the Treasury (up to 15%) from all matching requests. Furthermore, we aim to forge direct partnerships with recruitment services seeking developers, project managers, product owners, influencers, UX & UI Designers and more within the Solana Ecosystem.

For the time being, our repository remains private pending a comprehensive audit of our smart contracts. We've added the Solana Renaissance User as outlined in the documentation. 

Our project codebase is introduced in 3 parts:
1. smart contracts
- contracts code containing all smart contracts code
- dApp - simple dApp for verification of the interaction with the smart contracts method
2. backend - REST backend with PostgreSQL connection to control operability of the solution. It also communicates with our own AI core , however, the core is only called through REST interface, but is not provided in the codebase.
3. frontend - official dApp, that includes all connections to the smart contract and backend

We're on the cusp of launching our project into full production within the next 3 to 6 weeks. To do so effectively, we're focusing on enhancing our marketing strategies to welcome a broader community, a venture where support from the Solana Foundation would be invaluable. Our roadmap includes the development of a robust error-handening system and a user-friendly dashboard. We are currently developing a system designed to check walet tx history and integrate this data with a Treasury mechanism. This seeks to allocate additional social credits to members of the Solana community based on metrics such as their history with whitelists, NFT holdings, staking activities, frequency of contract interactions, and instances of code deployment to nodes. Through this method, we aim to accurately reflect a user's engagement and contribution within the Treasury allocation, ensuring a more precise and merit-based distribution of benefits.

## MeshMap + City Champ

### Description
MeshMap is building a 3D map of the world through community submitted 3D scans rewarded by token incentives and fun gameplay.

As a first proof of concept, we created City Champ, a mixed reality first-person combat and tower defense game developed for Meta Quest 2/3/Pro using Unity and Solana.

As a player, defend your city from ghoulish creatures borne from urban social problems. Blast enemies, defend the city core, and collect reforms to win.

As a scanner, scan the meshes for new play areas using your phone's built-in LiDAR scanner and submit to MeshMap to add endless level location possibilities.

### Details

- **Country:** Japan
- **Additional Info:** The scan upload demo is available at www.meshmap.com.  The City Champ Quest game apk is downloadable off the github to be installed with sidequest.

We also launched a MeshMap branded validator as part of the hackathon to promote the project and hopefully attract stake to subsidize development.

The City Champ game evolved from a 2023 experiment called Yimby Nimby War which was presented at the Network State conference at Breakpoint.  We are using enemy asset models that were created last year and we had conducted gameplay experiments for both PCVR and MagicLeap prior to this hackathon.  During the hackathon period, we designed and implemented the final gameplay, added hand control UX, did all quest 2/3 development, introduced 3D scanning, and integrated with the Solana blockchain.

## ESG Reporter

### Description
Solana x ESG Data Space Adaptor - "ESG Reporter"

Project Objective: Building Trust in ESG reporting.

“ESG Reporter” tackles the challenge of unreliable ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data. Our project leverages the speed, transparency, and security of the Solana blockchain to enhance the accessibility and reliability of ESG data. This, in turn, accelerates sustainable practices and investments across industries. By empowering businesses, investors, and regulators to make better decisions, we drive positive environmental and social impact.

The project will develop a dedicated Data Space Adaptor for the Solana blockchain. This adaptor bridges the gap between the EU Data Space Ecosystem  and the Solana ecosystem.

Our solution is particularly relevant in the following contexts:

The European Green Deal, CSRD reporting and EU data strategy, which emphasize sustainability and transparent data practices.
The SEC's ESG Reporting Requirements, which aim to standardize and improve the quality of ESG reporting.

The development of ESG Reporter benefits both the Solana ecosystem and ESG reporting market participants.

Benefits for the Solana Ecosystem:

Attracting a Large Number of New Users: Our solution caters to companies seeking to submit transparent and reliable ESG reports. Additionally, investors and financial institutions gain confidence in the accuracy of ESG data through our secure and verifiable reporting system. This influx of new users strengthens the Solana ecosystem.

Benefits for ESG Reporting Market Participants:

Increased Confidence in Veracity of Reports: ESG Reporter fosters trust in ESG data by ensuring the authenticity and immutability of submitted reports. This translates to increased confidence for all stakeholders involved in the ESG reporting process.

## Blob Wars

### Description
Blob wars is a multiplayer realtime strategy fully on chain game on solana. 

Players spawn blobs which generate color over time. This color they can then use to conquer other blobs. Conquered blobs then also generate color for the player. 

There is lots of tactics involved. Blobs generate color on a generation curve and where to postion your blobs is very important because the attack power falls off over distance. 

The color is derived from the player that is playing and the playing field is an NFT which saves all the game parameters like color regeneration time, fees and attack power of blobs.

## An Inflation-Resistant Stablecoin-backed Stablecoin.

### Description
Unless their issuers do something about it and go beyond the promise of parity with USD, both USDC and USDT are bound to hyper-inflate with USD. In order to be resistant to inflation and hyper-inflation, any stablecoin has to go beyond parity and boost the value of the stablecoin by increasing the amount of USD backing by an amount commensurate with how much USD has lost value. Is this even possible?

We present a solution to the problem of inflation for stablecoins. Our solution uses the popular OpenBook V2 smart contract (Solana program), which is a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEX, available only in Solana. Our DeFi app controls the mint price Pm and redeem price Pr. If inflation rears its ugly head, Pm is increased automagically, not to earn profits for us, but rather to accumulate more backing. Our backing is initially USDC only which is also available in Solana. As people buy our stablecoin ROKS at a higher Pm, the system starts accumulating more USDC backing to achieve a redemption price Pr beyond parity. In time, Pr can approach Pm. The algorithm does not rely on a secondary coin, which has proven to be eventually catastrophic.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** We did not complete the code, but at least we accomplished the following:
1. Using pre-existing code for the OpenBook V2 UI which we had to modify, we were able to create the ROKS Stablecoin market in code and also place a perpetual order.
2. Now we just need to write the routine for determining and setting Pm and Pr.
3. We decided to use the language solang to write the smart contract (Solana program). Solang is very much like Solidity for EVM, for which we have extensive experience.
4. We have the lite-paper in the github repo explaining the technical details of the inflation-resistant stablecoin.

## XAR

### Description
XAR is crafting an augmented reality universe where your creativity and adventure know no bounds. Here, you're not just playing a game—you're actively shaping a new reality. Utilize your phone or future AR devices like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest to transform the familiar into the extraordinary. 

All items in XAR are made of voxels, so everything can be disassembled and reassembled like in Minecraft, creating endless possibilities. Voxels also serve as the token and are central to the economic cycle. Players can earn voxels by playing the game(simply shooting the floating objects in your surroundings with the XAR app), while creators can buy voxels to build their own creativity and brand. They can then place these in display spaces to attract traffic and bring external value to the project.

In XAR, every street corner can turn into a battleground, every park a canvas for your imagination, and every cityscape a gallery for your digital art. We believe this social platform, with its brand-new AR visual experience, a voxel world fully destructible like Minecraft, and collaborations with other projects to drive significant traffic, will surely create a new wave of alpha on Solana.

Details About Bright. 


Title : Bright SCM - Cultivating Transparency, Harvesting Trust.

In Sierra Leone, agriculture is the backbone of the economy, providing livelihoods for a majority of the population. However, the agricultural supply chain faces numerous challenges that hinder its efficiency and effectiveness and also make it less attractive to citizens as a career for the nation's economic growth.
Transition to scenes showing various stages of the agricultural supply chain, including harvesting, processing, packaging, and transportation, highlighting the complexity and interconnectedness of the process.
From the moment a seed is planted to the time a product reaches the consumer's table, it passes through multiple hands and undergoes various processes. However, the lack of transparency and traceability in the supply chain poses significant challenges for farmers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers alike.
Farmers struggle to access finance for expanding their operations, while consumers find it challenging to trace the origin and quality of the products they buy. There is a clear need for a solution that can revolutionise the agricultural supply chain and address these challenges.

Key Features:
Product Tracking: Assigns a unique identifier to each product, allowing stakeholders to track its journey from farm to table.
Transaction Transparency: Records all supply chain transactions on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
Smart Contracts: Automates and enforces agreements between parties in the supply chain, such as payment terms and delivery schedules.
Data Security: Ensures the security and privacy of supply chain data using blockchain's decentralised and encrypted nature.
Marketplace Integration: Integrates with online marketplaces, allowing farmers to showcase their products and reach a wider audience.
Real-time Monitoring: Providing real-time monitoring of product movements, storage conditions, and other relevant data to improve efficiency and reduce wastage.
Investment Access Token (IAT): This feature allows users to purchase IATs, which represent a share in agricultural ventures. The system provides users
 with advice on suitable crops based on land data, climate conditions, and market trends. It also offers investment analytics, showing the expected return on investment, risks, and potential opportunities. This feature promotes transparency by providing users with detailed information on how their investment is used and the impact it has on the agricultural sector.
Inventory Management: Streamlining inventory management processes, including tracking and managing stock levels, orders, and deliveries.
Supplier Management: Managing supplier relationships, including onboarding, performance tracking, and contract management, to ensure a reliable supply chain.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Managing customer relationships and interactions to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Data Analytics: Using data analytics to gain insights into supply chain performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions.
Compliance Management: Ensuring compliance with regulations and standards related to product quality, safety, and traceability.
Supply Chain Collaboration: Facilitating collaboration between different stakeholders in the supply chain, including farmers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers.
Environmental Monitoring: Monitoring and managing the environmental impact of agricultural practices and supply chain operations. Blockchain Integration: Integrating blockchain technology to ensure the security, transparency, and integrity of supply chain data.
Grant and Resource Portal: The SCM system includes a grant and resource portal where governments, NGOs, and companies can upload information about grant opportunities, funds, seeds, and other resources available to farmers. Farmers can access this portal to view and apply for grants and resources that suit their needs. The portal includes features such as notifications for new grants, application processes, and tracking of grant utilization, ensuring transparency and accountability in the distribution of resources.
These key features work together to improve the efficiency, transparency, and traceability of the agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone, benefiting farmers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers alike.

 PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Lack of Transparency: The current agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone lacks transparency, making it difficult for stakeholders to track the movement of products from farm to table. This lack of transparency can lead to inefficiencies, as stakeholders may not have real-time information about the status and location of products.
Inefficiency: Due to manual processes and lack of automation, the agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone is often inefficient. Delays in processing orders, managing inventory, and coordinating logistics can lead to increased costs and reduced profitability for farmers and other stakeholders.
Product Traceability: There is a lack of robust traceability mechanisms in place to track the origin and journey of agricultural products. This can pose challenges in ensuring the quality and safety of products, as well as in identifying the source of any contamination or issues that may arise.
Constrains of Enhancing Agricultural Investment Accessibilty and information Transparency: One of the challenges in agriculture is the limited access to investment opportunities for individuals looking to invest in the sector. Many potential investors lack the necessary information about the agricultural sector, including data on land suitability for specific crops, investment advice, and access to reliable agricultural data.
Access to Finance: Farmers in Sierra Leone often face challenges in accessing finance for expanding their operations or investing in new technologies. Lenders may be hesitant to provide loans due to a lack of visibility into the farmers' operations and the risk associated with agricultural production.
Market Access: Limited market access is another challenge faced by farmers in Sierra Leone. Without access to larger markets, farmers may struggle to sell their products at competitive prices, leading to lower incomes and reduced opportunities for growth.
Fraud and Counterfeiting: The lack of transparency in the supply chain makes it vulnerable to fraud and counterfeiting. Products may be mislabeled or adulterated, leading to consumer distrust and potential health risks.

 Quality Control: Ensuring the quality of agricultural products throughout the supply chain is a challenge. Without proper monitoring and controls, products may degrade in quality or become contaminated, leading to losses for farmers and compromised safety for consumers.
Limited Access to Grants and Resources: Farmers in Sierra Leone face challenges in accessing grants, funds, and resources provided by governments, NGOs, and companies to support their agricultural activities. The lack of a centralized platform for accessing such opportunities hinders farmers' ability to improve their operations and increase productivity.
Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that integrates technology, such as blockchain, to improve transparency, traceability, and efficiency in the agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone.
Solutions:
Market Access: The SCM system provides farmers with access to a wider market by connecting them directly with buyers and retailers, both locally and globally, through online platforms.
Financial Inclusion: By providing transparent and traceable data on farmers' operations and products, the SCM system helps farmers access finance from banks and other financial institutions, enabling them to expand their operations and invest in new technologies.
Product Authentication: The SCM system ensures the authenticity of agricultural products by providing a transparent and tamper-proof record of their origin and journey through the supply chain, reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.
Grant and Resource Management: The SCM system includes a feature where governments, NGOs, and companies can upload grant opportunities, funds, seeds, and other resources directly into the system. This feature streamlines the process of accessing grants and resources, making it easier for farmers to apply for and receive support for their agricultural activities.

 Efficient Logistics: The SCM system streamlines logistics operations, including transportation, storage, and distribution, by providing real-time tracking and monitoring of products, reducing delays and inefficiencies.
Sustainable Practices: The SCM system promotes sustainable agricultural practices by providing data and insights into environmental impact, helping farmers make informed decisions about resource management and conservation.
AgriCoin: The SCM system can tackle this challenge by introducing a feature that allows users to purchase tokens or coins as an investment in agriculture. These tokens or coins can represent ownership or shares in agricultural projects or ventures. The system can provide users with detailed information about the investment opportunities available, including the expected returns, risks involved, and the impact of the investment on the agricultural sector.
Additionally, the system can leverage technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze agricultural data and provide users with accurate information about land suitability for specific crops. This can help investors make informed decisions about their investments and increase their confidence in investing in agriculture.
Furthermore, the system can provide users with investment advice and guidance based on their investment goals and risk tolerance. This can help users navigate the complexities of agricultural investments and maximize their returns.
Overall, by providing users with access to investment opportunities, reliable agricultural data, and investment advice, the SCM system can make investing in agriculture more accessible and attractive, thereby driving investment in the sector and supporting its growth.
Consumer Trust: By providing transparent and traceable information about products, the SCM system builds consumer trust and confidence in the agricultural supply chain, leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.
Regulatory Compliance: The SCM system helps farmers and other stakeholders comply with regulations and standards related to product quality, safety, and traceability, reducing the risk of penalties and legal issues.

 Data Security: The SCM system ensures the security and privacy of supply chain data by using blockchain technology, protecting it from unauthorized access or tampering.
Dispute Resolution: The SCM system facilitates dispute resolution between stakeholders by providing a transparent and verifiable record of transactions and agreements, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and conflicts. Capacity Building: The SCM system provides training and capacity building opportunities for farmers and other stakeholders to enhance their skills and knowledge, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain.
Grant and Resource Management: The SCM system includes a feature where governments, NGOs, and companies can upload grant opportunities, funds, seeds, and other resources directly into the system. This feature streamlines the process of accessing grants and resources, making it easier for farmers to apply for and receive support for their agricultural activities.
These solutions address the key challenges faced by the agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone, helping to improve transparency, traceability, and efficiency, and ultimately benefiting farmers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers.
Benefits for Farmers:
Access to Market Information: The SCM system provides farmers with access to real-time market information, including prices, demand trends, and consumer preferences, helping them make informed decisions about what to produce and where to sell their products.
Reduced Waste: By providing better visibility into the supply chain and improving inventory management, the SCM system helps reduce waste and spoilage of agricultural products, maximizing farmers' profits.

 Improved Productivity: The SCM system streamlines farm operations and supply chain processes, reducing manual work and paperwork, and allowing farmers to focus on more productive activities.
Fair Pricing: The SCM system provides transparency in pricing and transactions, ensuring that farmers receive fair prices for their products and are not exploited by middlemen.
Access to Finance: By providing verifiable data on their operations and products, the SCM system helps farmers access finance from banks and other financial institutions, enabling them to invest in their farms and improve productivity.
Risk Management: The SCM system helps farmers manage risks such as crop failure, price fluctuations, and supply chain disruptions by providing real-time data and insights into market conditions and supply chain dynamics.
Benefits for Customers:
Quality Assurance: Customers can be assured of the quality and authenticity of agricultural products by accessing transparent and traceable information about their origin and journey through the supply chain.
Food Safety: The SCM system helps ensure food safety by providing information on how products are handled, stored, and transported, reducing the risk of contamination and foodborne illnesses.

 Access to Diverse Products: Customers have access to a wider range of agricultural products from different regions, including unique and specialty items that may not be available locally.
Environmental Sustainability: The SCM system promotes sustainable agricultural practices by providing data on environmental impact, encouraging customers to make environmentally conscious choices.
Convenience: Customers can easily find and purchase agricultural products online through the SCM system, saving time and effort compared to traditional shopping methods.
Trust and Transparency: The SCM system builds trust between customers and farmers by providing transparent and traceable information about products, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
These benefits highlight the transformative impact of the SCM system on the agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone, benefiting farmers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers alike.
Conclusion:
A montage of scenes showcasing farmers using the SCM system to track their products, customers scanning QR codes to verify product authenticity, and stakeholders collaborating seamlessly through the system.
In conclusion, the Blockchain-based Supply Chain Management system is revolutionising the agricultural supply chain in Sierra Leone, benefiting farmers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers alike. By providing transparency, traceability,

and efficiency, the system is transforming how agricultural products are tracked, traced, and managed, leading to improved market access, financial inclusion, and environmental sustainability.
With the BRIGHT SCM system, farmers can access new markets and finance, while customers can enjoy fresh and quality products with confidence. Together, we can build a more sustainable and inclusive agricultural supply chain for a better future.

## Hermes Protocol

### Description
Hermes Protocol: A Decentralized Social Graph on Solana

Introduction:
Hermes Protocol is a groundbreaking decentralized social graph protocol built natively on the Solana blockchain. We believe that the future of crypto adoption lies in non-speculative use cases, leveraging blockchain technology as a global state machine and a solution to the double-spend problem. Hermes Protocol aims to provide users with a decentralized alternative to traditional walled-garden social graphs like Facebook and TikTok, offering true free speech backed by math and fair compensation for user-generated content.

Problem Statement:
In the era of deepfakes and AI-generated content, the authenticity and trustworthiness of online information are under severe threat. While AI can convincingly manipulate images, videos, and text, it currently cannot break the mathematical principles of public-private key encryption, which form the foundation of blockchain technology. This presents a unique opportunity to leverage the power of decentralized systems, like Solana, to create a social graph that is resistant to the dangers of AI-generated misinformation and disinformation.

Traditional social media platforms, operating as walled gardens, offer little to no compensation for users and minimal ad revenue sharing. Moreover, they lack true free speech, as they are not backed by the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology. The rise of AI and deepfakes exacerbates these issues, making it increasingly difficult for users to trust the content they consume and engage in meaningful interactions without being overwhelmed by intrusive communication and spam.

Hermes Protocol aims to address these challenges by building a decentralized social graph on Solana, leveraging its global state machine capabilities and encryption algorithms. By utilizing public-private key encryption, Hermes Protocol ensures that all interactions and content are securely attributed to verified identities, making it nearly impossible for AI to impersonate users or manipulate the social graph.

Furthermore, by integrating payments directly into the protocol, Hermes Protocol creates an economic incentive structure that discourages spam and encourages high-quality content creation. Users can impose costs on communication, such as requiring micropayments for access to their inbox or content, effectively filtering out unwanted interactions and ensuring that legitimate users can engage freely without being drowned out by noise.

The combination of cryptographically verifiable identities and built-in payment mechanisms creates a powerful deterrent against AI-generated misinformation and disinformation. Bad actors attempting to introduce fake content under a verified identity risk severe reputational damage, as their actions are permanently recorded on the blockchain. This accountability creates a strong incentive for users to maintain the integrity of their digital identities and the content they share.

Solution:
Hermes Protocol's solution revolves around on-chain identities defined by unique usernames paired with SPL-NFTs. These identities form the foundation for all on-chain interactions within the protocol. Key features include:

1. On-chain metadata updates by owners, allowing users to control their profile picture, header, description, privacy status, subscription status, and subscription requirements.
2. On-chain communication, supporting public posts, encrypted DMs, and email-like protocols. This ensures that all interactions are securely stored on the blockchain.
3. Monthly subscriptions to access private content, facilitated by delegating USDC to a PDA (Program Derived Address) controlled by the recipient user, which can be called via a public cron job.
4. User interactions such as reactions (supporting ANY emoji), replies, bookmarks, and more, all recorded on-chain.
5. Follow functionality with privacy controls, allowing users to follow other profiles, request to follow private profiles, and approve or reject follow requests.
6. Fair and decentralized profile minting through public auctions, minimizing front-running and ensuring equal access to profile origination.
7. Integration with new social platforms as a universal social login, similar to "Login with Google" in the web2 world.
8. Rich post content support, including compressed images, videos, and GIFs, in addition to plain text.

By leveraging PDAs and other Solana-specific features, Hermes Protocol ensures that all interactions and data are securely stored on-chain, providing a tamper-proof and censorship-resistant social graph.

Future Roadmap:
1. Native mobile support, prioritizing the Solana Saga mobile stack for seamless user experience.
2. Event-driven pipeline for on-chain user activity (mints, posts, reactions, etc.) to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
3. Optimized timeline and resource loading for a more responsive user interface.
4. Frames support, similar to Farcaster, enabling native Solana dApp integration into posts and exploring referral fee incentives for sharing and promoting content.
5. Token incentive system, inspired by Steemit, rewarding early users for minting, posting, and referring new users, with post rewards based on viewership and engagement.

Hermes Protocol is excited to share its progress and vision for a decentralized future of social media. While the current implementation is a proof of concept and may have rough edges, the team is committed to refining and expanding the protocol to create a more equitable, user-centric, and secure social media landscape.

## Satik: Platform for Decentralised Brand Deals

### Description
Satik helps create on-chain contracts between influencers and brands where influencers are paid for both views and sales they bring for brands, on the fly. 

In the present, Brand deals are based on prediction of how a content is going to perform which can be risky for the brand. And influencers don’t have any way to truthfully know the sales they bring to a brand, unless they are told by the brand, and it’s in the brand's interest to downplay the sales.

Satik helps brands reward influencers on both visibility and sales. Satik can help brands transparently reward influencers for sales they bring. Influencers can also be transparently rewarded in Solana for views they garner for the agreed content. 

This can help smaller and foreign content creators and brands collaborate without trusting each other explicitly.

Satik helps brands reward influencers for both visibility and direct sales.

### Details

- **Country:** Nepal
- **Additional Info:** Website: https://satik.xyz 
(Website is currently in devnet. You should have no problem running a demo contract. Feel free to email at getsurajjha@gmail.com if encountered any problem.)

Elaborate Pitch Deck: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGBuztxP0U/Eh4Wp2pJOsVwp9Fmb9PWKA/view?utm_content=DAGBuztxP0U&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=GOv7kejMlw

Steps to try for yourself:
1) Make sure you are on devnet and your wallet has some devnet SOLs. Then you can go to https://satik.xyz and connect your wallet.
2) Then click on Influencer tab and create a Influencer account. Connect another wallet(then refresh tab), click on Brand tab and then create a Brand account.
3) Go to created influencer profile and click on "Initiate Contract". Add product and fill the form. You will need to add Redeemer URL, which is the URL where customers will be redirected after they purchase the product.
4) Then you'll be redirected to webpage builder to create a page. Create a page and then attach products from right hand panel to the components or buttons you've added to your webage. Purcahse will be initiated when clicked on these connected components/buttons. You can submit then.
5) Now you can connect your Influencer wallet and accept the proposal you just received from your brand account. You can then click on the IPFS link and create purchase. For now (while testing)your wallet will automaticaly mint tokens(USDC) needed to purchase the product. 
6) You'll be redirected after puchase to redeemer URL where you're supposed redeem the payment for both influencer and brand. For now the payment will only be tranferred to a escrow account. And you'll need a server who can sign the transaction will correct redeemer key to redeem the transaction will in submitted demo and in real life will be done by brand.

## Soldea

### Description
Our platform provides a system where entrepreneurs can present their projects and investors can participate in them. When entrepreneurs apply, we meticulously review their projects and list those that meet our criteria on our platform. Once the predetermined amount is collected from investors within a specified period, we release the funds to support the development of the projects in line with the milestones set by the entrepreneurs. Investors receive project-specific tokens in exchange for their investment, allowing them to share in the success of the project.

According to the roadmap set by the entrepreneur, funds are disbursed to the entrepreneur in stages, based on certain investment milestones reached by a DAO formed with previous investors. When the project is completed, the generated revenue is distributed among the shareholders. This approach enables investors to directly benefit from the success of the projects and increases the value of their investments as the projects grow.

## Okam.ai

### Description
An open marketplace for private AI

We are building a trustless marketplace and execution platform where top AI engineers can post their pre-trained models. All models are kept private through the use of end-to-end, token gated encryption.
Usage rights for these models can be bought and sold as NFTs, and owners of these NFTs can deploy the models onto DePin providers such as IO.NET.

We differentiate ourselves from classic compute and storage providers such as Hugging Face and other cloud platforms by helping AI engineers employ a trustless licensing model thanks to our end-to-end encryption, and we want to offer significant reductions in serving costs thanks to our utilization of decentralized physical infrastructure, as opposed to centralized datacenters.

### Details

- **Country:** Croatia
- **Additional Info:** While the demonstration is for an EVM-based marketplace, a Solana marketplace is in the making, and we're actively working with Lit Protocol to bring e2e trustless encryption to Solana.

## [ See2 Link ] -- Your Ultimate Web 3.0 linktree .

### Description
See2 Link aims to provide a secure, convenient, and highly customizable digital identity aggregator with both presentation and authentication features, meeting the complex needs of Web2 and Web3 users in modern digital life.

Integrated with SNS, the ultimate Web 3 version of linktree (see2 link) not only offers a comprehensive platform for personal or brand presentation but also enables users to manage their Solana identity and assets with personalized domain names, further simplifying the authentication process and facilitating personal brand building.

As an aggregator, see2 Link does not directly manage the original assets linked to users' wallets. Instead, it focuses on providing personalized display options for users, such as de-identification, anonymity, de-association, or emphasizing associations, to accommodate different user asset display needs. Through the issuance of certificates (such as see2 passport NFT), it helps users prove the association of their assets, lowering the barrier for users to participate in the ecosystem.

## GLAM

### Description
GLAM is a decentralized on-chain asset management protocol on Solana that enables efficient management and operations of investment products, empowering investors to have greater control and equity in their financial futures.

### Details

- **Country:** Switzerland
- **Additional Info:** Demo: https://devnet.glam.systems
Deck: https://pitch.com/v/glam-cf4y9g

Everything you see in the video should work and be secure. Here's what we learned/achieved:
* Used Token-2022 / token extensions via CPI (not many examples available)
* Mapped (a small subset of) openfunds.org onto token metadata extensions
* Carefully tested the visual in user wallets (Phantom, Backpack) and explorers
* Integrated Drift using delegated account via CPI (kind of hacked our way from their IDL)
* Built a segregated treasury account, it should be pretty secure for usage on mainnet
* Building policies using token extensions transfer hooks
* Definitely learned that we're very optimistic when planning demos :)

To meet the deadline, we had to cut some corners:
* The performance data and chart are estimated
* AUM is calculated from holdings in treasury but doesn't include positions in Drift
* While most metadata is on-chain, a few fields are still not, and similarly some fields in the create form are placeholders

We can't wait to hear your feedback!

How much time does it take to write an article? How long does it take to add a software feature? How long does it take to make a poster And how much money does this require?
In globalized remote work (or DAO organizations), it is particularly necessary to quantify uncertain work and place it in a task pool for project members to freely choose and implement. For the project team, it is necessary to promote at a stable speed, just like the industrialization of Web2; For organizational members, this is a very fair way to receive rewards and leave records on the blockchain.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** This idea was inspired by agile's point card process. Where people use fibonacci numbers to estimate the amount of effort each task might need. Because in the engineering world, there's no such thing as perfect estimation. So having a group of people deciding tend to give a better estimation.

## ExtractoDAO 

### Description
ExtractoDAO, the pioneer in the blockchain space, introduces the world's first decentralized exchange (DEX) designed to revolutionize the trading market of real physical economy products. Unlike traditional exchanges, ExtractoDAO focuses on listing future smart contracts for entrepreneurs and producers in the non-securities market of tangible products.

Our platform is founded on transparency, accessibility, and innovation. We have strategically aligned ourselves with regulators to obtain supervision to list all assets that are not considered securities, ensuring a compliant and democratic financial market. This unique positioning allows ExtractoDAO to be the bridge between the physical economy and the blockchain, providing a decentralized trading environment for assets that fall outside the conventional commodities or securities categories.

ExtractoDAO stands out in its commitment to supporting small-scale producers globally. Through our platform, these producers can access the capital needed for sustainable production, breaking down the barriers they often face in traditional financial systems. Our mission is to create a fair and transparent marketplace that benefits all participants, fostering trust and efficiency in the trading of innovative and unique products.

Key Features of ExtractoDAO:

Comprehensive Asset Listing: We are dedicated to listing a wide variety of assets beyond traditional commodities or securities. Our platform aims to support the trading of unique and innovative products, promoting diversity and inclusivity.

Legal Compliance: ExtractoDAO operates within the bounds of regulatory frameworks, ensuring that all transactions on our platform adhere to the relevant laws. We prioritize working alongside regulators to maintain a compliant and trustworthy marketplace.

Smart Contract Repository: Our platform offers a secure and immutable smart contract repository, guaranteeing the correct execution of agreements between parties. This functionality ensures a reliable environment for transparent and verifiable transactions.

Global Accessibility: ExtractoDAO is accessible to entrepreneurs worldwide, including those in regions with less developed economies. Any country can list its companies and products for trading, providing global visibility to traders worldwide.

Decentralized Trading: Smart contracts are traded peer-to-peer without third-party intermediation, eliminating the need for custodianship and providing users with full control over their assets.

Innovation in Capital Access: We provide an alternative route to tokenization, allowing advances in capital from third parties to producers via blockchain. Entrepreneurs receive investments directly into their digital wallets without intermediaries like banks.

Risk Mitigation: The platform carefully evaluates smart contract listings, exempt from registration by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission. While it does not review offers in advance, ExtractoDAO strives to provide clear risk warnings and investor educational materials for informed decision-making.

ExtractoDAO introduces a groundbreaking solution to the global timeshare market, empowering builders to list and sell their timeshare globally, transforming the way people access and utilize timeshare properties. This innovative platform mitigates the challenges faced by builders in reaching a global audience and provides a secure and efficient avenue for transactions.

Key Features of ExtractoDAO's Timeshare Trading Platform:

Global Accessibility: Builders can now showcase their timeshare properties to a global audience, expanding their reach beyond traditional boundaries. ExtractoDAO facilitates instant transactions in USDT, USDC, ensuring swift and secure payments directly to the builder.

Secure Transactions: The platform eliminates the risk of misappropriation or custody issues by facilitating direct payments to the builder. This ensures that every penny from the timeshare sale goes directly to the builder, providing a trustworthy and secure transaction environment.

Document Verification: Buyers can verify the legitimacy of timeshare properties through Drawer technology, accessing all legal documents related to the property. This transparency builds trust between buyers and builders, fostering a reliable marketplace.

Resale Opportunities: Buyers have the flexibility to resell their timeshare on the DEX if they no longer wish to use it. The platform facilitates seamless transfers of usage rights through smart contracts, ensuring legal compliance and transparent documentation.

Effortless Transition of Ownership: The platform manages the transfer of ownership rights smoothly, documenting all legal aspects of usage rights and dates through smart contracts. Additionally, the buyer's KYC information is securely stored for a hassle-free reservation experience.

DeFi Integration for Rental Income: For those who choose not to utilize their weeks, they have the option to lock the smart contract and earn rental income in DeFi. This innovative feature allows users to capitalize on their timeshare investment by participating in decentralized finance.

Liquidity Pool Rewards: Rental incomes are deposited into the liquidity pool, and individuals who participated in the rental receive returns in USDT, USDC and DAI. The returns surpass those offered by traditional DeFi platforms, providing an additional incentive for users.

✅ About Team & LinkedIns: 

Ani: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-srinivas-clssgb-793071a6/

I’m a STEM professional with a Bachelor’s in Mechatronics Engineering and a Master’s in Industrial engineering from the University of Texas. I've worked as a Program Manager in the Automotive industry for companies including Volvo. I entered Web-3 in 2017 as a trader and met my co-founder Felix in 2018 at a Singapore tech conference. My experience includes consulting for Quickswap (AMM DEX on Polygon), Tezos Foundation, Dogechain, and contributing to the Shiba Whitepaper. Me & Felix also consulted for and built an NFT Commerce marketplace scaling it to 20K active users. This sparked our interest in SocialFi and specifically social commerce, leading us to extensively research this domain (including interviewing merchants, customers) and study the opportunity in North America where this phenomenon had started to take shape (influenced by the success of Social-Commerce in the SEA & China markets). The results of our research and interviews showed promise that led us to found Boom.

I'm a STEM professional with an Accounting degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I initially worked at Baker Tilly, then ventured into entrepreneurship by opening Math Coaching centers across Singapore, expanding to 6 locations in five years.

My involvement in the crypto space began in 2020 as a trader and consultant, focusing on community and product growth for various projects. My work with Ani on Nafter deepened our interest in SocialFi and particularly in commerce, leading us to research the social-commerce industry in North America, finding our market opportunity and creating Boom.

## mE.T.F

### Description
mE.T.F allows you to create your own personal token, a token that represents you.

Our thesis is simple: in today’s attention-driven economy, the most engaging thing for people is other people. Platforms like Friend Tech and memecoins like Boden are the early manifestations of a wider trend. One that will inevitably attract influencers and celebrities into creating their own official tokens that represent them.

However, launching your own token comes with a slew of challenges. Legal implications, fair transparent distribution, ensuring reasonable liquidity so the token can be traded on the open market. You’ll need some degree of technical knowledge and then you’ll need easy consensus that this is the official token for you. Because there will be copycats.

Our solution is mE.T.F. Best-in-class legal terms and disclaimers, standardized process for transparent launching tokens. A bonding curve mechanism which allows anyone to start a token for just a few dollars. Zero technical knowledge, and consensus built from Twitter authentication.

We ensure drama free fair play and a steady passive income stream for creators. No insider allocations, no accusations of dumping - just fans having fun while creators reap the rewards.

## Space

### Description

### Details

- **Country:** Malaysia
- **Additional Info:** Slide Deck: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGBsPItOhY/Tu7FP15gTZBu6PD3J8WV0Q/edit?utm_content=DAGBsPItOhY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

Demo Video: https://youtu.be/O-GFHYufdOI

Various job posting platforms such as Upwork, Indeed, Linkedin and Glassdoor doesn't guarantee payment of salary between job seeker and company. These platforms doesn't use trustless payment. Moreover, most job posting in these platforms are either full time, part time or freelance which doesn't provide user full flexibility in terms of job time, location, working method and how salary is counted.

In addtion, certain platforms requires the usage of token to apply for job yet they doesn't refund unused tokens as cash to the user, which causes the issue: Platform doesn't refund user's tokens. In other words, NOBODY wants to work while paying certain number of cash to the platform, people work to earn salary or get rewarded !

To futher elaborate, bounty posting platforms including Superteam Earn, Hackerone, Bugcrowd have limited user groups. For instance, Hackerone targets bug bounty hunter or cybersecurity researchers. Apart from that, these platforms has limited job availability since they do not have a diversity or user group but a niche one.

Introducing Space:
A Web 3 Project Posting Platform that nurtures Bounty-Based Projects through

- Project Partitioning
- Escrow Smart Contracts
- Enterprise Diversity

Which solves the issues mention above.

Space uses escrow smart contract to automate and make settlement of salary seamless and trustless. In addition, Space targets Design, Business and Finance freelancers as out first audience. In the future, we plan to expand to the Education, Research and Marketing, Software Development and Cybersecurity.

## TicketWave

### Description
TicketWave, with its innovative use of NFT technology, is poised to revolutionize the ticketing landscape. By embedding the security and transparency of blockchain into ticketing, it aims to enhance both the fan experience and the economic model for organizers. Despite NFTs' potential to mitigate fraud, it is a challenge yet to be embraced by major concerts and protocols like GET due to concerns over revenue impacts and the monopolistic hold of traditional ticketing giants like TicketMaster or LiveNation. TicketWave offers a new narrative. It challenges the status quo by demonstrating how NFTs can secure transactions and unlock new profitability avenues, advocating for a partnership approach over disrupting the existing infrastructure like GET protocol did. This strategy not only respects the established market dynamics but also introduces a viable, win-win solution for the industry's future.

The Team Leader, JY embarked on this project after falling victim to a $500 scam, an experience many others have shared. This incident wasn't just a loss, it was a call to action. It ignited a determination within JY to create a solution that would prevent others from enduring the same frustration and disappointment. Assembling a team of fellow music and concert enthusiasts was intentional, our shared passion fuels our commitment to the project. Together, we're not just building a platform, we're nurturing a vision to scale up and eventually collaborate with our favorite artists, turning our collective dream into a reality. We will keep continue building this and scaling this up despite we are still university students as we are destined on Earth to build this to help more people.

## Car2Sol

### Description
The current landscape of vehicle trading is plagued by inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to fraud, hindering both buyers and sellers from conducting transactions with confidence. Existing online car dealership platforms, while convenient, often rely on centralized systems prone to manipulation and data breaches, leading to distrust among users. Furthermore, the complexity of cross-border transactions exacerbates these challenges, with disparate regulations and currency exchange risks adding layers of complexity and uncertainty. As a result, there is a pressing need for a secure, transparent, and efficient vehicle trading platform that leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the way vehicles are bought and sold, offering a decentralized solution that ensures tamper-proof transaction records, streamlined processes, and enhanced trust for all parties involved.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** Heya, couple notes:

1. no twitter for hotheads - as a solo dev on this project I decided to focus on tech.

2. branding - you might notice references to the old name 'blockslayers' in assets - part of the branding process which is still incomplete.

3. Hackaton scope:
Obviously, some of the codebase was created before the hackathon (most notably the game server)
this hackathon was specifically focused on Solana integration and restructuration of user flow I was referring to in the video presentation.

## Chomp

### Description
Chomp, a gamified social consensus platform that gets you best-in-class insights.

For the user, it's a fast-play quiz, polling or trivia game that gets you the most likely answers to a question. Under the hood, we implement a set of social consensus mechanisms adapted from empirical research around the wisdom of the crowd problem. Through first giving your own answer, and then your perception of others’ answer to the same question, we can obtain the true state of the world, even when most players of the game do not know what that true state is. 

Chomp is the first mini-game product created by Gator Labs. We intend to build out more gamified applications that feed into Gator's underlying reputation graph and data layer, which would be composable with businesses looking to build with a reputation graph or highly accurate information that benefits their end users.

### Details

- **Country:** Germany
- **Additional Info:** Note 1: Gator Labs is currently raising for a small angel/preseed round, please see our pitch deck for more details:
https://docsend.com/view/tdv84yt9b558mkrp (link expires on April 30th)
PW: gatorchomps

Note 2: Before starting on Chomp, we actually completed two rounds of user research for another product, Swamp. Like Chomp, Swamp also aims to aggregate and distill high-signal information for users, but through a set of social consensus mechanism that includes a staking function and reputation graph. The user research for swamp is what inspired us to design and build Chomp, a faster game with more low-lift interactions. See Swamp under Gator's V1 landing page: https://gator.fyi/. 

Gradually, we plan to bring in elements of Swamp’s underlying social consensus mechanism and reputation system into Chomp, or release that as a separate product.

## Trumen World

### Description
Trumen World, brings the earth online and onchain!

Trumen World is an innovative location based social platform designed to enrich real-life experiences with a special combination of Game-Fi, Social-Fi and Metaverses experiences. In a world where everyday life can sometimes feel boring compared to the vibrant stimulation of games, Trumen World aims to bridge that gap and transform real-world adventure into an engaging, rewarding journey powered by the crypto - the perfect reward system connecting real and digital worlds! 

Users can visualize their real world exploration progress and earn rewards through a combination of gamification and GameFi. In the meantime, users can create decentralized airdrops on specific real world regions and promote events or local business. The airdrops are only claimable when visitors are within a certain range and this brings 100% real traffic to the designated location. 

We believe with crypto as the perfect rewards system, and the unique gamification method to visualize and experience the real world as a gigantic metaverse, Trumen World will become a huge scene in 2024!

### Details

- **Country:** Canada
- **Additional Info:** Everyone only lives once, but life feels less exciting compared to the games. Because that in games there are designers who make cool visualizations, reward system, trackable progress, and leaderboard for you to get addicted through a combination of positive feedback. However, none of these exist in real life. 

And we are aiming to elevate the real world into an ultimate verse via the gamification and the power of crypto so that everyone can enjoy their life like how they enjoy the games

We are overlaying a mysterious fog layer on top of the real world map where when users explore the world they are clearing the fog and visualize your real world exploration. Users can also create decentralized location-based air drop regions that's only- a claimable when other users enter in this region. And this unlocks a web3 promotion platform and a decentralized advertising for local business.

That is how we're bringing earth online and on chain. We're making this next generation web3 consumer app that gamifies the real world interaction, rewards users by crypto and integrate everything you need to enjoy your grand life game!

## Project Eden

### Description
Project Eden is an initiative to bring the world of Web2 to blockchains and it starts with passwordless wallets for Solana that can be setup in seconds by anyone with an iPhone.

Register an account within your browser using any independent two-factor authentication device with secure biometric capabilities and get setup within seconds. No need to remember passwords or write down seed phrases. WebAuthN private keys are stored within dedicated hardware enclaves within the authenticating device and never leave their home. Utilizing domain-based usernames allows for cross-device compatibility if used with Apple keychains.

### Details

- **Country:** Malaysia
- **Additional Info:** LIVE DEMO - https://projecteden.app/demo/

VIDEO DEMO - https://youtu.be/x1cGtLN081E

PITCH DECK (PDF) - https://projecteden.app/deck.pdf

VIDEO OF MY FIRST PITCH - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aZbNqTXy0H0A2LS7AE7NFEjwHqGgIpRd/view?usp=sharing

We have spent the majority of this hackathon researching and developing the underlying authentication methods for the wallet and have not had much time to work on Solana specific functionality beyond generating addresses and sending SOL - all without passwords or PINs.

Built upon the latest FIDO WebAuthN standards, Eden utilizes newly available extensions such as RPF and largeBlob to enable this new ultra-secure authentication protocol to be used for wallet generation. Due to being at the bleeding edge of what is possible with modern internet security devices, it currently has limited support for Chrome browsers with (or only using) iOS devices as authenticators. More support for additional browsers and authentication devices coming as soon as they are able to catch-up with Apple!

Moving forward and turning this hackathon idea into a business, we have a different pitch:

Imagine a world where everything you did and owned was protected by a single identity that you controlled, which did not rely on passwords or written recovery seeds, where every online action was merely a tap or two away from accessing anywhere … Welcome to Eden.

## Solana Smart Contract Auditor

### Description
As part of this hackathon, We have built an LLM-powered smart contract auditing tool. This enables developers to quickly perform a security audit on their smart contracts so find vulnerabilities and fix them and prevent common known hacks, thereby making the ecosystem super secure.
The best part about this tool is, we used an open source LLM and finetuned it with a dataset, the tool can be downloaded on the user's PC or a free colab account and used. This is decentralization at it's finest.

We have finetuned an open source model - Mistral7B with a custom dataset to be able to detect smart contract security issues in Solana code.

We have OPEN SOURCED our fine-tuned model on huggingface - https://huggingface.co/ArmurAI/solana_smart_contract_auditor

## Oridion

### Description
Simple application that adds a buffer between your public and private wallets.
It's essentially just a bunch of PDA accounts (planets) that are available for the public to passthrough.

You deposit your funds and it randomly lands on a planet. You can then continue to hop through more planets or withdraw to any wallet. Once withdrawn, all internal hop data is deleted. 

When tracing back from your destination wallet on a Solana explorer, you’ll see your funds pass through the application accounts without any association of your deposit account which obscure the origin of funds as they may be mixed with other users while passing through the planets.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** https://oridion.xyz.
The app is currently set for devnet. 
I'm looking to push to Mainnet soon once I gather some funds. 

The pitch deck should cover most details since the app is so simple. 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CPG8ptc6y2Qf9QL6lnSCl2ZcH6xaovjVsakRnIQc6Dk/edit?usp=sharing

I added a link to the repository for the Anchor program. 
Here is the link to the Lambda functions that trigger the anchor program. 
https://github.com/Oridion/Lambda

 If the front end Next.js repo is needed please let me know and I can upload that as well.  

Thank you for checking out my little app!
I know it’s simple and can be easily replicated but I thought Solana community should have at least one of these types of public services within the community.

## MirChipotle: the decentralized dining

### Description
Mirchi, an Indian word for Chili, embodies the spice and flavor that define Indian cuisine. Chipotle refers to grilled jalapeño, a staple in Mexican cooking and a famous Mexican fast-casual company. At MirChipotle, we aim to offer innovative and healthified Indian cuisine. We're reimagining the vibrant flavors of India with a healthier twist, crafting both nutritious and delicious dishes that cater to a wide array of dietary preferences without compromising on taste.
Our Goal:
The Chipotle part of MirChipotle underscores our ambitions to become an international household name for fast-casual dining. Inspired by the global success of Chipotle Mexican Grill, we envision MirChipotle as a fusion brand that marries aromatic, flavored Indian spices with the universal appeal of fast-casual dining. We aim to do that to Chipotle ($80 billion MC), which Solana is doing to Apple and Ethereum, by 2030.

We're not just creating meals; we operate on four crucial elements: Indian tastes, healthier food options, blockchain adoption, and global sustainable growth. Join us on this journey as we bring a slice of India to the global level, making MirChipotle a synonym for healthified, swift, and flavorful dining across continents.

## Asset Recovery Tool 

### Description
A common attack vector to compromise user wallets is to assign their wallet account to a program (so it it not owned by the SystemProgram anymore), from here on this shall be referred to as a wallet got "bricked".

We have built a tool that allows users with a bricked wallet to recover their assets. This is done by connection a second wallet that acts as a feepayer.
We support native recovery of SPL token accounts as well as stake accounts.

Furthermore there is a transaction builder that lets you execute arbitrary transactions (based on base64 encoded transactions, like solflare displays them). With this people can get assets locked in protocols, transfer cnfts, claim certain airdrops etc.
Features include: adding instructions (create token accounts, unbrick wallet if you bricked it yourself), changing accounts in the transactions, showing transaction simulations and accout changed.

The tool also allows for bricking a non-bricked wallet. This can be helpful when the private key was leaked as it prevents the attacker from doing certain things (anything that requires rent to be taken from the account directly). 
When at a later point in time the wallet can claim an airdrop (or whatever) it can be unbricked and the claim can be performed in the same transaction.

The tool is fully open source and deployed at:
https://solana-asset-recovery.vercel.app/

### Details

- **Country:** Germany
- **Additional Info:** If you are testing the tool make sure to add a custom RPC under "Clusters"

We are intending to keep adding features to this tool. If you want to checkout the state as of project submission checkout this branch:

It's a solution designed to solve the core pain points of traditional systems, delivering a smoother and more equitable gaming experience.

### Details

- **Additional Info:** I ain't in the business of selling subscriptions. I'm building revolt.  Fees so low they're an insult to greed itself. And the real deal – you own the assets, you call the shots.  But it's not just about the tech, this is a community revolution. Our platform is a haven where developers and gamers speak the same language. No corporate suits dictating the rules, just direct collaboration and innovation.

## Solana-volunteersDAO

### Description
I'm building the Solana volunteers DAO，My goal is to popularize Solana in the Asia-Pacific region!。I use saga 2 as a bridge to open the door to web3 for web2 users。Thus achieving solana’s user growth. In addition, I issued cnfts to all chapter 2 holders and established saga2HOME on TG to help everyone improve their security awareness and provide the latest airdrop consultation. Increases user stickiness and prevents users from accidentally losing it.

If I get funding I will create a full time working group. Currently, everyone in our DAO community is part-time, except me.
Our current traffic data in the Asia-Pacific region is 3,000+ monthly visits, helping saga2 to close 100+ transactions. When I establish a full-time work group, I will double this number within 3 months and 5 times after 1 year. Our project may seem small, but I feel it is very important! Because many new users will be defrauded inadvertently and lost permanently. With our presence, we will help new users solve the problems of pre-sales consultation and purchase on the depin track and getting started with web3 technology. It will also allow new and old users to find Solana’s home! Discover the charm of Solana!

Second: We also found a local team and reached a strategic cooperation. It is a hardware wallet in the depin track. We will copy the sales model of saga2 and improve and innovate it. This is why I need this grant! I believe we will create our own depinDAO community model in the future. We will help all hardware project parties in the sol chain ecosystem. Do pre-sales and after-sales service! This is a great thing! Not only has the hardware marketing been done well, but also the cultural popularization of Solana has been done well! We are all doing this now! I hope this funding will increase our impact and help more people!

I have mentioned in the budget proposal that we can popularize new users through hardware bridges. Achieve the effect of attracting new people. Then join our TG group and do a good job in user tracking and maintenance. In this way, our community grows in every project and helps every project party. Because as far as I know, the project side is really not good at pre-sales consultation and after-sales maintenance. Our goal is to be a third-party project provider for the overall pre-sales consultation and after-sales service of Solana Ecosystem! Hope official support!

We love Solana! If we didn't get funding, we would have done it ourselves!

## Steno-NFT AI

### Description
StenoNFT AI is a decentralized project based on a shorthand application we developed to hide and retrieve textual data in the pixels of an image. In this system, users can hide text or program triggering codes in the images they print as NFTs, enable all NFTs in a collection to dynamically communicate with each other, or create many creative development tools using the infrastructure.

works by using a unique supervisory mechanism that matches the pixel values of images with their ASCII values to load data hidden inside the images. This mechanism allows all images within a collection to communicate, creating a kind of "Internet of NFT". The developed algorithm works in synchronization with the algorithm that performs the steganography process.

The algorithm can process a packet of information or program trigger data ranging from 4000 to 10000 characters and convert it into a 7 to 21-bit representation and 3 keys. When the 21-bit data is sent to the blockchain, a copy of the content is embedded in the pixels of the image with a specific encryption. These representations work with blockchain confirmation, so that triggering scenarios of data packets or application transactions can happen again.

This technology is designed as a developer tool that can be used in many areas such as data security and monitoring, automatic triggering and contract execution, tokenization and licensing, data verification and identity management, distributed transaction optimization, alternative blockchain communication module, as well as creating triggers to run other algorithms with the collective action of a collection of NFTs.

Our project aims to develop NFTs in many areas, including coin technical projects, by expanding their use cases, and to realize unprecedented community activities.

### Details

- **Country:** Turkey
- **Additional Info:** While this project may seem to focus on NFTs, it is actually working on an infrastructure for information compression and data transformation. Our goal is to test algorithms and architectures we are developing through NFTs and create funding with NFT visibility. As we progress in our roadmap, our aim is to translate this infrastructure into protocols and development tools that can be adapted to many blockchain technical projects involving data processing and compression. As a simple example, the additional steps introduced by the Huffman algorithm create a cyclical data processing process. The outputs of these cycles can be used as a highly combinatorial encryption protocol. On the other hand, STENO-NFTs are opening the door to many new NFT use cases such as identity creation for games, more effective community synchronizations, and so on. The system will be open to developers. Therefore, the usage areas of NFTs will multiply synchronously with the creativity of users. The STENO-NFT project is planned in 3 steps. The first step consists of the contents we present in this project proposal. In the second step, we plan to turn all visual and auditory formats into data sets with additional functions using StenoSimulation and blend these sets with AI technologies. In the final step, we plan to take our developed infrastructure outside of digital arts, directly convert it into a usable format in blockchains, and evolve it into a Solana technical project.

## SecureSol Insurance

### Description
With SecureSol Insurance, we ensure that insurance policies are stored safely by distributing them to blockchain networks with IPFS. Users' insurance policies are safe and since fraudsters cannot access this information, they are prevented from creating fake policies. In addition, a revenue model is provided by staking some of the insurance payments made by users, thus making the Solana network more secure and increasing users' trust and loyalty to this insurance system. The other part of the payments of incoming insurance users is invested according to traditional methods against risks, providing an income model.

## Greedy World

### Description
Play to Earn, 3rd Generation GameFi, Tokens Battle Royale, you are both the hunter and the hunted. Task: Collect tokens, escape. No Pledge, No Mining, No Ponzi.

### Details

- **Country:** Vietnam
- **Additional Info:** https://linktr.ee/greedyworld
#Background
Greedy World started as a research project on the diversity of the crypto ecosystem, where we wanted to redistribute tokens through an interesting rule where the game is just a vehicle. Therefore Greedy World is an ecological product, or a strategic product, which is positioned as a long-distance runner, seeking to go further, not faster.

#Introduction
Play to Earn, 3rd Generation GameFi, Tokens Battle Royale, you are both the hunter and the hunted. Task: Collect tokens, escape. No Pledge, No Mining, No Ponzi.

#Features
Token Diversity
Interesting asset flows
Exploring Human Nature

#Ecological Value
During the game, you might unexpectedly gather tokens you've never invested in before, thereby transforming you into a token holder. When Greedy World supports over 100 token assets, you'll discover that it transcends being just a game. It gradually transforms into a multi-token platform, or rather, a tool facilitating token liquidity. Even during market downturns, it can still help tokens stay alive. When integrated with Chain-ecosystem, it has the potential to unleash tremendous commercial value.

Business model
4% inheritance tax 
** If you are killed in the game, the tokens you were carrying in combat may be picked up by other players and the inheritor will be subject to inheritance tax.

#Vision
We believe that the Web3 world isn't limited to the mine-withdraw-sell model, we are looking for a healthier, more compliant and diverse development path. Greedy World returns to the most primitive game rules, assisting Web2 users in a smoother transition into the Web3 world, thereby benefiting the entire crypto sphere. Let's collectively inspire a brand new track.

## Tokens & SMiles

### Description
Tokens & Smiles has its own token designed to replace mileage-based reward systems used by airlines. Travelers can earn this token by providing their past flight numbers and redeem them for various privileges.

In the future, it is going to have a unique NFT for each passenger to match his/her user's account on airline websites.

### Details

- **Country:** Turkey
- **Additional Info:** A project-specific token, Tokens & Smiles token (TST) is generated and is used to claim rewards from flights. The claimed amount of tokens is calculated according to the distance between departure and arrival airports in miles. Currently, live data is not used for the calculation and therefore, src/components/flight_data.json is created and used for this purpose but in the future, it will be replaced with the real data.

Idea:
To address these challenges, we propose Tokens & Smiles, a decentralized loyalty program that offers a unified and transparent rewards system for airline customers. By leveraging blockchain technology, Tokens & Smiles ensures fair and consistent rewards for all users, regardless of their airline or banking affiliations.

Value Proposition:
The core value proposition of Tokens & Smiles lies in its ability to provide a seamless and rewarding experience for airline customers. By offering a unified rewards system that is decentralized and transparent, Tokens & Smiles fills a crucial gap in the market, empowering users to maximize their rewards and enhance their travel experience.

Future Plans:
Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance Tokens & Smiles by introducing personalized NFTs tied to user profiles and flight history. These NFTs will enable users to claim rewards and access exclusive benefits based on their travel patterns.

Additionally, we aim to expand our partnerships with airlines and integrate new features to make Tokens & Smiles the go-to loyalty program for frequent flyers worldwide.

## CupomCripto

### Description
**Introducing Solana Rewards: Bridging Web 2 with Web 3**

Our groundbreaking project aims to revolutionize the online shopping experience by introducing a cutting-edge cryptocurrency cashback app, specifically built on the Solana blockchain. With the goal of popularizing Solana and integrating both Web 2 and Web 3 universes, our platform offers users the opportunity to earn Solana (SOL) tokens as rewards for their online purchases.

**Enhancing Accessibility to Solana:**

One of the primary objectives of our app is to enhance accessibility to Solana and foster widespread adoption of the blockchain technology. By providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for earning Solana tokens through everyday online transactions, we aim to demystify the process of acquiring and utilizing cryptocurrencies. This initiative not only expands the user base for Solana but also contributes to the broader crypto community.

**Empowering Financial Inclusion:**

Financial inclusion lies at the core of our mission. Through our app, users from diverse backgrounds and financial standings can participate in the crypto economy simply by engaging in their routine online shopping activities. This democratization of access to Solana rewards empowers individuals to take control of their financial futures and participate in the digital economy.

**Seamless Integration of Web 2 and Web 3:**

Our app serves as a bridge between the traditional web and the decentralized web. By seamlessly integrating cashback rewards in Solana tokens into the familiar framework of online shopping, we facilitate the transition for users from the traditional financial system to the decentralized ecosystem. This integration fosters a symbiotic relationship between Web 2 platforms and Solana, driving mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.

**Strategic Partnerships for Growth:**

We recognize the importance of strategic partnerships in achieving our goals. By collaborating with a diverse range of online retailers and e-commerce platforms, we ensure that users have access to a wide array of opportunities to earn Solana rewards. Additionally, partnerships with influencers, brands, and industry leaders amplify our reach and strengthen our position in the market, ultimately driving the popularity of Solana rewards.

**Educational Initiatives for User Empowerment:**

In addition to providing a platform for earning Solana rewards, we are committed to empowering users with knowledge about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Through educational initiatives, tutorials, and resources integrated within the app, we aim to demystify blockchain technology, promote financial literacy, and equip users with the tools they need to navigate the digital economy confidently.

**Advancing the Solana Ecosystem:**

Our project is not just about incentivizing online shopping; it's about driving the growth and adoption of the Solana ecosystem. By creating a use case for Solana tokens in everyday transactions, we contribute to the utility and value of the Solana blockchain. This, in turn, attracts developers, entrepreneurs, and investors to the Solana ecosystem, fostering innovation and driving its evolution as a leading blockchain platform.

**Introduction of Platform Token:**

Furthermore, we have plans to introduce a platform token within our ecosystem to incentivize transactions and participation. By offering additional rewards and benefits through our native token, we aim to further incentivize engagement and foster a vibrant and active community within our platform.

In conclusion, our Solana Rewards app represents a transformative step towards popularizing Solana, integrating Web 2 with Web 3, and empowering individuals to participate in the digital economy. With a strategic vision, user-centric approach, and commitment to education and inclusivity, we believe our project has the potential to revolutionize the way people engage with cryptocurrencies and contribute to the growth of the Solana ecosystem.

## DeAnno

### Description
Our application is divided into two sides: the supplier side and the demand side.

The supplier side is aimed at individuals who can provide annotation capabilities (referred to as "workers"), similar to the concepts of the gig economy or crowdsourcing. These workers are distributed worldwide and are not employed by the platform; they simply pick up tasks on the platform and earn token rewards. They can later trade these tokens independently.

Worker earnings = Annotation unit price * Work volume * Annotation quality coefficient * Work proficiency

The demand side targets those who require annotation resources, typically AI companies. They publish their tasks and pay commissions, and upon acceptance, the corresponding tokens are automatically distributed to the workers. Adjustments to the worker's earnings weighting coefficient are made based on feedback.

## SMART CONTRACTS TO SUPPLY MEDICAL PRESCRIPTIONS

### Description
As firm believers of people´s right to health access and having experienced several issues ourselves, we have identified that there is an existing necessity for efficient prescription distribution among users of the health system. 
In Colombia, although there are entities in charge of distributing medicines to users, there are multiple difficulties such as the speed of order processing, prescription availability at designated drugstores, users moving to distant places for prescription collection, cost of transport, among others. Existing software development tools are quite expensive and require high human processing intervention, besides, prescription inventory is a big issue given that the entities providing medicines to users (drugstores) at times do not have availability of some medicines in a specific store but have lots of this same medicine at some other location, making it difficult for users to get their prescription whenever they need it.
Our main purpose is to offer a user-based solution mediated by AI & Smart Contracts. This solution considers the most urgent user needs such as:

1 Faster process: With smart contracts, process speed and privacy, increase, creating a better experience for patients and less complaints against HCPs.
2 Cost-Effective inventories: Having the necessary medicine inventory according to patients´ needs, helps improve inventory quality and is cost-efficient for designated drugstores. 
3 Forecasts: Having smart contracts allows stakeholders to:
•	HCPs: have a more accurate forecast of medicine cost and follow-up of patient needs. 
•	Designated drugstores: improve inventory cost, allowing the company to send the exact amount of medicine needed in different locations. Also, in case medicines are not available, medicine can be sent to the patient´s address. 
•	Customer Experience: Patients will have better processes and in case the patient suffers an accident, doctors can access patients´ records to check all their medical history. This will help doctors to prescribe or not, according to the patient´s existing medical conditions. 
SOLUTION 
Creating smart contracts for medicine will solve the issues for the actors involved in the process such as:
•	Better process time for the patient to receive the medicine prescribed.
•	Better cost inventory processes for the designated drugstores
•	Better customer experience for HCP´s patients

## Eco Planet

### Description
We are a team of crypto-enthusiasts, which worried about the ecological situation on Earth. 

Nowadays around the world, people have a lot of ideas about how to reduce the amount of plastic, how to make goods with eco-materials, how to protect animals etc.

But these solutions have one big problem - these activities do not attract enough people at least because they are mostly voluntary

And we can introduce new solution with the usage of blockchain and cryptocurrency how to attract people to reduce the amount of plastic around the Earth. It’s similar to **play-to-earn** business model, where people will have a worthy reward for their contribution to cleaning the planet from pollution.

Main problem

The problem of environmental pollution is becoming more and more urgent every year. Pollution is killing, changing the cycle of the seasons and bringing the possibility of disasters across the world closer. 

So, in the last few years across a lot of countries in Europe and the USA appeared automatic machines which allow you to put plastic bottles inside and receive rewards for recycling. The reward is a certain amount of money which you can spend in the shop or market where the machine is located.

Ok, but what product we are offering?

We have developed an application using NEAR smart-contracts (moving to Solana blockchain now) in order to enable enthusiasts and volunteers around the world to receive additional rewards for cleaning the Earth and at the same time popularize cryptocurrencies (and tokens on Solana blockchain) among a new generation.

A feature and one of the main advantages is that we can use already existing plastic recycling machines by adding just a QR code at the bottom of the check they give you.

By handing over bottles, users receive a cryptocurrency that they can withdraw at the end of the season.

At the same time, we offer gamification including a general table of users, a social rating, as well as multipliers with which users can earn more by moving up in the rating table.

Each season continues for at least a month, and users can complete unique seasonal and weekly tasks, by completing which the user can receive either additional coins, social points or other interesting rewards.

Innovation:

We are using blockchain to solve environmental problems, as well as popularizing the crypto industry through socially significant activities. A large number of governments are highly-interested in plastic recycling and our project has a potential chance of getting funding as an initiative to speed up and improve this process.

Future plans:

- Completely move to Solana blockchain due to
    - low commissions and fast transactions
    - better development experience and ecosystem, stable SDKs and and more convenient tools for frontend
- Test our product on first users in Kyiv, now signing an agreement on cooperation with recycling company to test our product

We are building a Distributed Training Network for Large AI Models - imagine the world’s largest AI, trained by everyone, for everyone - see: nmesh.io

Our design is based on Predictive Coding Network (PCN) where our team and advisors from Oxford have authored a significant portion of papers in recent years on this topic. PCN is designed with true parallelism and low network overhead as the first-class citizen, that cuts training costs and unlocks massive potential. 

The hackathon code will focus on building an MVP and proving the performance equivalence between PCN and Back Propagation (BP, primarily used by AI model training but with high network cost and not true parallelism) in a smaller model.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** Our design is based on a cutting-edge technology called Predictive Coding Network (PCN). 

PCN is designed with true parallelism and low network overhead as the first-class citizen. For example, it will reduce the data transmission per layer per epoch for ChatGPT3-175B training from 7.3GB drastically to 170KB - consumer GPUs can comfortably join. 

- Why us?

Our team and advisors from Oxford have been working in this field for years and authored a significant portion of papers. 

Beyond that we are a strong team with skills complimenting each other: 
Shawn Ying (Co-CEO): PhD in CS from NTU Singapore, associate professor at Tianjin University, ACM/ICPC Finalist. MultiVAC founder. #Business, #Tech
David Huang (Co-CEO): Bs and MSc from Peking University. 10-year Googler and experienced tech lead manager for a multi-tier organization for one of the world’s most used services. #Management, #Tech
Diego Hong (CTO): MSc from Oxford. Experienced Meta engineer, tech lead for chatbot LLM. PCN expert. #AI, #PCN, #Tech
Kenchia Lee (CMO): BA from Peking University and MA from UCL. Experienced project manager, handling multiple projects (average contract value exceeding $2.5 billion) in Latin America. #Operation, #Marketing.

- Why wasn’t this solved by someone else already?

1) Back Propagation (BP) is the backbone of nearly all modern neural networks, it’s efficient and well established with central clusters, big corporations aren’t incentivized to change that.
2) PCN though has been researched in the field of neuroscience, it has only become a research topic in AI within the last 10 years, and our team has been in the leading front in Oxford.

## Edubuk

### Description
Summary: dApp to Digitally Record & e-Seal Educational and Work-Experience Certificates on the Blockchain making it significantly cheaper and faster for Universities and Employers to conduct background verification process of Students and Employees

Details: Our dApp provides eSealing and Hashing and Time Stamping of the certificates & documents on the chain for the certificates & degrees issued by the University, and for transparent verification on chain by 3rd Party Verification Companies and by US/EU/AUS/NZ Universities: This will ease the pain of Universities to accept only genuine students, in a faster and cost-effective manner. Hence our solution (www.edubukeseal.org) on the Blockchain is gaining traction in the market by Universities in India and by 3rd party transcript verification service provider in the US.
This dApp will be a full blown scalable version of the CV & Resume being recorded on the Blockchain where every line mentioned in the CV will be clickable and a link to that information stored publicly on the Blockchain.

The complete Edubuk profile of the candidate on the Blockchain will have the following features recorded on the chain:

1.) Learning Medium & Resources
2.) Credits & Grades
3.) Academic Certificates
4.) Professional Certificates (Work Experience of Corporate)
5.) Subjects, Courses & Projects Studied
6.) Interests, Hobbies
7.) Online Education Courses completed
8.) Online Skill Based Courses completed.

This dApp will have 2 layers:

1.) eSeal Layer: to Record the Certificates and Transcripts on the Blockchain: for University & Students and for HRs & Employees in Corporates.

2.) Verification Layer: to Verify the already stored Certificates and Transcripts on the Blockchain by University Admins or by HRs in Corporates.

Once this profile is created (customized Edubuk profile for each candidate: freshers, students and employees), then we will use AI (Artificial Intelligence), NLP algorithm to sift through the Edubuk profile of the candidate having all the information about his/her academics, skills, credits, grades, previous employment history (if any) and then this information will be used to map it with the most relevant job openings out there in the market. Hence, each potential employee will get to see only most relevant job openings suiting his Edubuk profile and each HR in the corporate will be able to see only the most relevant candidate which matches the skills and requirements as per the Job Description of the Relevant Job opening.

Hence, this will be an AI driven Transcript & CV Recording and Verification Protocol on the Blockchain.

### Details

- **Country:** India
- **Additional Info:** Overall we have signed 15+ MoUs with Universities, Study Abroad Agencies, 3rd Party Transcript Verification Companies to use our eSeal solutoin which is now developed during this hackathon finally. Edubuk has signed an MoU with IEE (International Education Evaluation), an 18 years old, US based Transcript Verification and Evaluation company, recognized by US Department of Education, NACES Member, providing 100K+ transcript evaluation reports each year to 800+ Universities in the US, including Harvard and MIT, among others. Their website: www.myiee.org and our landing page on their website: https://myiee.org/university/edubuk
For Edubuk, this means we will be doing 100K+ transactions on chain each year for recording each transcript evaluation and verification report and then Universities will verify the report securely and transparently on the blockchain.
This starts a new era of Background verification of students who go to US, Canada and EU for studying (Bachelors or Masters) abroad.

We have been selected to integrate our blockchain solution of recording and verifying certificates on the blockchain with the NSDC (National Skills Development Corporation) portal. This is a  central skilling portal of the Indian Government for the youth of India. This selection is done for top 10 Startups out of 500+ that applied across India, each startup will provide different service to the portal. We are elated on this selection in the "screening and verification" theme and wanted to share with all of you. The public announcement will come this week (Friday), via an event in T-Hub, Hyderabad, India (largest startup incubator in India). This gives us access to millions of college students studying various job oriented courses in India on the NSDC portal to have their course completion certificates recorded on the chain. Here is the NSDC Website: https://nsdcindia.org/ and here is the Program that we are selected for: https://programs.t-hub.co/skill-india-digital-accelerator/ 

We are building a 2 sided utility model:

1.) Colleges & Universities: a) We are doing B2B Tie-ups via MoU signing with Indian and US Universities to start with;
b.) Students going for study abroad will have to go through transcript recording and verification on the blockchain; c.) Tie up with 3rd Party International Transcript Verification Companies like IEE and WES (in the US) under NACES membership.

2.) Corporates: In the next phase, once phase 1 of University tie-ups and business is on its way and completed; we will do B2B Tie-ups with Corporates (Employers). Current & Potential Employees will have to get their previous work-experience certificates recorded and verified on the blockchain. Pushing colleges to record educational record on the blockchain for employers to check & verify on the chain.

30+ global award won (all 100% on merit): Edubuk’s patent published model is globally award winning and recognized by various reputed organizations including G20 Summit in Indonesia (2022), (Best Edtech Startup Jury’s choice out of 100 Startups), CNN, Financial Times, MIT University, Harvard University in the US, World Economic Forum (Davos, Jan 2023), AWS Edstart, IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur, IIM Calcutta, Polygon Blockchain, Cardano Blockchain, The HINDU, CNBC, MoneyControl, RaiseMoney, IDFC-First Bank, Inc. 42, NASSCOM, State Government of Telangana (India), Dubai Expo 2020, TiE Delhi, TiE Mumbai, Data Innovation Bazaar, Telangana AI-Mission, Bombay Stock Exchange’s Impact Startups, TimesNext, European Digital University, among many others.

The parts of our solution that will be on the chain will be the 6 entries for each of the certificate mentioned on the CV: a,) Who the certificate was issued to, b.) who is it issued by, c.) what is the certificate about, d.) unique file hash of the certificate, e.) time stamp of the certificate (when the certificate was recorded on the chain, in UTC time) and f.) who recorded the certificate on the chain (witness' wallet address). Now if there are 100 such links on the CV (mentioned as certificates of academics or of Job: then there will be 100 * 6 = 600 entries stored on the Blockchain for one CV). Now if there will be 100,000 students recording their profiles using Edubuk's solution on the blockchain then there will be 600 * 100K = 60 Million entries on the Blockchain.
