CTRL+X is developing licensing software to help journalists maintain ownership of their content. For the RADAR hackathon we built a system for journalists to import their content archives from the Ghost CMS and mint a license of their published articles as NFTs on the Solana blockchain. The text is encrypted and stored on Arweave. Once minted, the NFTs can be purchased in our Reader view and full text accessed for micropayments as small as $.01USD. This mechanism enables the buying and selling of single articles and creates immediate new revenue streams and distribution pathways for journalists everywhere.

## Glasshouse

### Description
Glasshouse is a validator service designed to help users effortlessly stake their Solana (SOL) or guide them to various "earn" programs for maximum returns. With Glasshouse, users can delegate their SOL for staking, secure rewards, and participate in cutting-edge liquid staking programs like Jito, Super Stake SOL, and others. Glasshouse simplifies the staking process and connects you with the best opportunities, empowering you to grow your assets securely and efficiently within the Solana ecosystem.

### Details

- **Country:** Ukraine
- **Additional Info:** Glasshouse offers an innovative approach to staking that benefits individual users and strengthens the entire Solana ecosystem.

First, users maximize the value of their assets through access to liquid staking tokens (such as JitoSOL, mSOL, and bSOL), allowing them to earn staking rewards while simultaneously participating in DeFi projects. This ensures capital efficiency, as tokens remain liquid and can be used for additional earnings through lending protocols or yield farms.

Secondly, by integrating with other DeFi applications and platforms, Glasshouse helps attract new liquidity to the Solana ecosystem. The use of liquid staking tokens, especially JitoSOL, which includes rewards from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), provides users with additional incentives to stake their assets. This increases overall network liquidity, making Solana more appealing to new investors and users.

Additionally, by supporting decentralization through the delegation of stake to multiple validators, Glasshouse contributes to making the network more resilient and less vulnerable to congestion, improving the overall performance of Solana.

In this way, Glasshouse's approach not only benefits individual users by providing higher rewards and liquidity but also makes the entire Solana ecosystem more attractive, stable, and sustainable. This, in turn, draws in more liquidity and enhances the network’s growth potential.

## Social Insurance On-chain

### Description
The product I am currently working on is called Social Insurance On-chain, which helps Crypto users or organizations contribute to social insurance for themselves or others on blockchain networks. This not only helps establish future security but also fills a crucial gap in building network states.

There are a few reasons why I decided to create this product:

	1.	A large number of Crypto natives do not trust the existing monetary/financial system, including the social insurance system, believing that such Ponzi-like designs are prone to collapse.
	2.	Regularly setting aside funds for retirement on the blockchain requires a high level of self-discipline, which many find difficult to maintain.
	3.	Many blockchain companies also need a social insurance solution for their employees that aligns better with crypto ideals.
	4.	In my view, network states will be the mass adoption phase of the blockchain industry, and on-chain social insurance will be a key piece in building these network states.

For these reasons, I first proposed and implemented the Social Insurance  On-chain product on social networks.

## Reflect Protocol

### Description
Reflect Protocol: Fully On-Chain Decentralized Tokenized Hedging via Delta-Neutral Currencies

Reflect Protocol is the first entirely on-chain, autonomous, and decentralized tokenized hedge protocol. It implements a Productive Cash Carry (pCC) Delta-Neutral strategy, utilizing Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) as collateral to generate stable yields ranging from 8-50%+. The protocol's DEX controller aggregates multiple sources of perpetual liquidity, allowing for permissionless rebalancing to optimize yield and manage risk effectively.

At the core of Reflect Protocol is the Autonomous Attestation & Risk Engine, which systematically assesses all relevant risk factors to produce an algorithmic risk score. This on-chain risk engine enables automated responses to key metrics such as funding rates and open interest percentages, setting a new benchmark for risk management in DEX-based DeFi environments.

Users can hedge their LSTs and earn yields in major global currencies, including US Dollars (USD), Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), and United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED). By acting as a Global Currency Exchange (CX) for productive stable currencies backed by hedged cryptocurrencies, Reflect Protocol provides essential infrastructure for zero-slippage forex operations and supports the development of composable financial solutions within the decentralized ecosystem.

For more detailed information about the protocol, visit learn.reflect.cx.

## Soundromeda's Odyssey: Artist Discovery

### Description
Soundromeda’s Odyssey: Artist Discovery project is a series of games that blend classic gaming with a seamless, powerful music discovery experience. Accessible to Telegram’s 950 million active users, Discord’s 200 million active users and directly on the Soundromeda website, Odyssey's first game installment, PYRAMIDZ, is a breath of fresh air for artists and fans, easing the music industry’s reliance on social media as the avenue for artist discovery.

Problem Statement
With over 100,000 songs released daily, the music industry is oversaturated, making it increasingly difficult for independent artists to gain visibility and for fans to discover new music. Traditional discovery methods are inefficient, leaving room for a more engaging and structured solution.

Solution: Odyssey - Artist Discovery on Soundromeda
By integrating with the Solana ecosystem via Phantom Wallet and the music platform Audius, Odyssey taps into a vast library of over a million songs. Users can explore their favorite genres, mine for hidden talent, and collect VibeCards—rare, onchain proofs of the artists they’ve uncovered. The sooner an artist is discovered, the rarer the card becomes.

Play Pyramidz and earn provable street cred: Command your pyramid-shaped spaceship through asteroids in a thrilling 8-bit Space Invaders-style adventure, all while navigating music’s uncharted universe. Whether you're discovering emerging talent, the next Post Malone or Fred Again, Odyssey provides a groundbreaking way to discover and support new artists. Start your journey today.

## Solana Improvised Multisender and Vesting

### Description
The Multisender for SPL and SOL  tokens offers an efficient solution for large-scale token distributions by optimizing batch transfers. Our tool intelligently handles different scenarios for handling SPL transfer: if an associated token account (ATA) does not exist, the multicenter batches SPL token transfers across 9 to 12 accounts. However, if the ATA exists, it maximizes efficiency by processing transfers to up to 22 accounts in a single transaction. This feature reduces transaction complexity and enhances scalability, making it a powerful tool for managing token transfers in various blockchain applications. This project also has vesting functionality similar to Bonfida(that we have open-source code)

## Point0x (Point Zero)

### Description
I've always hated the idea of having to rent space just to hold tokens I won't use for long (I know I can just close the account, but you know how it is—we're lazy).

So, I created the Token Compressor app for Solana, which leverages zkcompression (https://www.zkcompression.com/) to compress and decompress any token at will, without needing. to pay 0.0002 SOL/Token anymore!

I also added a storage-free swap feature that will decompress your token -> swap via Jupiter -> compress it again.

## ClickCrate

### Description
Distributed headless multichannel e-commerce platform for consumer RWAs

A distributed headless e-commerce platform that allows creators to sell everyday real world assets in digital experiences at the click of a button anywhere, anytime. ClickCrate enables embedded purchases of RWAs (primarily physical consumer goods) complete with a single decentralized source of truth for products (an on-chain product registry + program) and an api that connects to any payment processor/order manager allowing truly multichannel fully composable yet headless e-commerce straight out of the box. With Blinks we've been able to lower the barrier even further for people to be able to easily embed products for sale into digital experiences like DSCVR, Twitter, Reddit, Gmail, Pinterest etc.

Creators can use our no-code dashboard to create, place, and manage products, listings, and associated Points of Sale (POS) while devs can do the same with even more fine grained control by using our API or even calling our on-chain Solana program directly. As the inventory for a product placed into your Point of Sale (POS) sells you will receive earnings form your sales and can cashout via the dashboard. But the best part? Your sales are direct and aggregated across platforms while your earnings stay 100% yours, not beholden to 30% app store fees.

Connect your existing order manager like Shopify and sell physical goods on all platforms simultaneously! Unlock truly social e-commerce! Meet your users where they are!

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** We used Metaplex Core NFTs, Dialect Blinks, and Anchor to build our project.

We built an on-chain program, dashboard, chrome-extension to render blinks on nearly all socials, and storefronts to aggregate multiple products into one blink.

## The Grid

### Description
For developers, creators, and gamers: unlock 3D potential with instant models, robust tools, and an endless AR metaverse.

### Details

- **Country:** India
- **Additional Info:** Inspiration

The idea for The Grid was inspired by the lack of a unified platform that caters to 3D creators, developers, and gamers alike. While there are marketplaces for 3D models, none combine free access to over 10 million models with the ability to mint and integrate them into popular creative software or games. We saw this as an opportunity to merge creativity with functionality, providing tools for professionals and a metaverse experience for gamers.
What it does

The Grid is a 3-in-1 platform that serves as:

    A marketplace with over 10 million free 3D models available for download.
    A SaaS model that integrates with Blender, Unity, Unreal, and Three.js via extensions, allowing creators to seamlessly import and use 3D models in their projects.
    A cross-platform AR metaverse game where users can place, mint, and interact with 3D models in the real world using the blockchain.

How we built it

We developed the marketplace using a robust tech stack that includes ReactJS for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, and AWS for cloud storage. We then built extensions for creative software using APIs from Blender, Unity, and Unreal to make integration seamless. Finally, the AR metaverse game was built using Unity 3D, ARKit, and the blockchain for minting.
Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring seamless integration with multiple platforms. Creating extensions that work across Blender, Unity, and Unreal involved overcoming API limitations and ensuring compatibility. Building the AR game also required dealing with latency issues in real-time model placement and interaction. Lastly, scaling the infrastructure to support millions of 3D assets and a growing user base was a constant challenge.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We’re proud of developing a platform that caters to multiple audiences—creators, developers, and gamers—all in one place. We’ve built a solution that not only simplifies 3D model access but also enables creators to bring their visions to life more efficiently. Additionally, the successful implementation of cross-platform gameplay and minting using blockchain is a technical milestone we’re proud of.
What we learned

Throughout this project, we learned the importance of cross-platform compatibility and the challenges that come with blockchain integration. We also gained deeper insights into optimizing user experience when dealing with large datasets and ensuring scalability for a platform intended to serve millions of users.

## Cross chain AMM

### Description
Cross-Chain Automated Market Maker (AMM) enables seamless trading of assets across multiple blockchain networks without the need for intermediaries or centralized platforms. Traditional DEXs are typically confined to a single blockchain, limiting access to assets on other networks. Cross-Chain DEXs solve this problem by providing liquidity pools and mechanisms that facilitate asset swaps across various chains, unlocking a more interconnected and liquid ecosystem. The platform ensures efficient liquidity aggregation, low fees, and secure cross-chain swaps, empowering users to access decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities across different blockchain ecosystems with a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Copy Trade Cat

### Description
During this hackathon, I developed a working prototype that allows members of a Discord channel to mirror trades onto each other’s wallets. The idea is to provide an easy way for users to delegate trade permissions, on their wallets, to trusted community members, so everyone can work together – to find and manage trading positions. Our future vision includes providing tools for DAO communities to vote on trade actions, enabling individuals to join together – to run fully self-custodial hedge funds, and allowing top performing traders to earn extra bonuses/commission/tips from their communities. I intend to enhance the security of accounts and transactions, providing more protection from MEV (Miner Extractable Value), and integrate with additional chains and exchanges. The mission is to create a social, collaborative, and convenient environment for trading, aligning with my personal mission: to end loneliness.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** Thank you for considering my submission. I developed this project independently after learning about the hackathon on its start date. Despite initial efforts to form a team, I chose to proceed solo to bring this idea to fruition within the given timeframe. I believe in the saying, "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."

I'm passionate about the Solana ecosystem and have actively contributed by organizing community meetups in Southern California, including the inaugural Solana Beach meetup and another in Silicon Beach, Santa Monica.

If selected, I'm eager to continue developing this project, potentially find a co-founder, build a dedicated team, and contribute further to the Solana community through events and collaborations.

## Coinfair

### Description
Coinfair is a new DEX that can dominate crypto trading

1. The trading depth can be better than the top CEX by algorithmic fitting.
2. Decentralized commissions can be tens to thousands of times the CEX, determined by the coin price increase multiplier, and can be paid in real time.
3. Because of the good trading depth, the trading fee does not need to go back to the liquidity pool, and can be fully distributed to the market.

## Coping

### Description
Coping is a mobile application that I made a while back. Now it's a lot of active users monthly and I decided to add a Solana to my app. The app is designed to fight any addiction. It helps our users fight smoking, vaping, gambling, drug abuse, alcohol, and self-harm. While being a non-profit it showed great interest. I was thinking of building a community and adding rewards. But only on Solana, I can implement really useful things for users. F.E. They can lock, or stake, money for some time, and receive it back with profits only if they remain "clear".

## Gladiators.meme

### Description
Gladiators is a Web3 game designed by and for crypto natives, offering a PvP battle experience infused with crypto lore. Inspired by Pokémon-style combat, players battle with "gladiators" that represent various memecoins, with each gladiator's stats dynamically adjusted based on the real-time performance of the tokens they represent. This creates a constantly evolving gameplay experience that's deeply connected to the crypto market.

To acquire a gladiator, players must stake memecoins, turning their coins into powerful in-game assets. Once equipped with their gladiators, players can start battling and also place bets on their battles using this stake. Gladiators harnesses the power of internet native communities and the emerging trend of financialized culture in the crypto world, creating an intersection between gaming and memecoins.

## S.I.C.K 

### Description
Onboarding the Next Billion Users in Crypto through Social Investment Strategies

To truly democratize crypto adoption, we must bring investing into the social sphere. Our platform introduces a community-driven approach where users can share investment strategies, participate in copy trades, and earn referral rewards. By incorporating these social incentives, we aim to make crypto accessible to everyone, including non-technical audiences.

The centerpiece of our platform is the introduction of Crates — structured investment products modeled after Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Crates allow users to diversify their portfolio across multiple assets within a secure, blockchain-based framework, minimizing risk exposure. Each Crate is a pre-designed allocation of crypto assets that users can invest in with varying risk profiles.

In a decentralized ecosystem, transparency and trust are key. Rather than relying solely on a centralized authority to verify the credibility of investment Crates, we leverage Web3 principles. Users can vote on the performance and reliability of each Crate, utilizing on-chain governance mechanisms to ensure credibility and enhance collective decision-making. This decentralized voting process empowers the community to actively participate in curating investment opportunities, making the platform self-regulating and resilient.

## Asteora 

### Description
Active Liquidity Management on Meteora DLMM Pool with yield as high as 20k%+ APR.

### Details

- **Country:** Thailand
- **Additional Info:** DeFi on SOL has not mature as ETH ecosystem yet => A lot of Opportunity
That’s why Meteora DLMM has crazy yield (24h Volume higher than TVL)
BUT, you have to actively monitor and manage the pool to be within concentrated range
What if…, you have already forward test/backtest that the fees captured is still worth a lot more than IL and rebalance slippage that occurs when u go out of range
Active Liquidity Management!

By capturing 20% of Meteora Volume ($135m daily) -> $27m daily volume -> 1% fees from the volume -> 270k fees -> we can take 5% on those fees -> $5m yearly revenue
That would put us in the top Asset Management protocol by revenue
More than Pendle!

## Surfer

### Description
Surfer is a user assistant in the Solana ecosystem. Our goal is to create a positive experience and expedite the growth of the ecosystem. We have gathered all the popular Solana services and resources in one place - Currency Exchange, Swap, Bridges, DEX, Earn, Learn, Developer resources, News and much more. To close the full cycle of user interaction, we are developing the first currency exchanger using smart contracts on Solana. In addition, the user can use the constructor to create their own space with the necessary resources and services, design it in their own style, and share it with friends, thereby attracting even more users to the ecosystem. It's magical.

### Details

- **Country:** Ukraine
- **Additional Info:** - I would like to draw your attention to the fact that now the user does not need to use CEX. Because now Platorm will have a unique service and the first of its kind currency exchange aggregator on Solana using smart contracts that our team is developing day and night. 
- Another innovation is a dynamic designer with which you can design the platform in your own style and create your own selection of necessary services and resources. This functionality should provide the user with a positive experience in interaction with the Solana ecosystem.

2. Brief Story and Challenges faced during Project Building: All of us are completely new to Solana but are having decent 2 years of experience in EVM Chains, Algorand and Alephium blockchains and came to know about the Hackathon only around a week ago. We all were working solo but then met each other in a local "Superteam Co-Hack Meetup" and decided to build a project together.
     -> Aditya, here was good with his Frontend Skills so he quickly built a beautiful PWA for us.
     -> Nipu had some past knowledge of Solana and Rust in General and I (Shyam) having knowledge of EVM Chains started working on the Backend Code.
     -> In the Co-Hack Meetup, we came up with the implementation idea and started working.
     -> But since we had never set up Solana and had Windows laptops we faced lots of challenges.
     -> I and Aditya are working full time and Nipu had his college in between so we tackled everything and wrote the smart contracts.
     -> For the past 3 days we tried our level best, completed our contracts, and interacted with the wallet to sign a transaction to implement the purchase but bidding actions were throwing some errors due to some windows limitations.
     -> We tried to connect with fellow devs and devs from Superteam but still, we were not able to complete the whole implementation.
     -> Though in the last few days, we learned to set up Solana, write some level of Smart Contract in Rust, and interact with Phantom, and Solflare, using Serum and Anchor. 
     -> We know were very very close to completing it, we debugged and came to the point where the PDA was generating fine but since we did not have deep knowledge, we were not able to complete the actual interaction with the contract and wish we could get few more days or could have started earlier.
     -> The APP has still lots of features to work on and we will keep working on it and deploy it officially.


3. All in all, it was good to come together and build something, at least we found a Team for future Hackathons, to participate seriously and try our best to build something meaningful.

@apevesting - CTO, Co-Founder
Purdue University dropout. Received grants from Solana Labs. Currently building a DEX in partnership with LayerN and Amber Group. Fellow Bermudian. Grew up watching communal football clubs sponsor and compete in leagues of their own in a very successful manner. 

Addendum: AlphaFC Proof of Concept and Club Acquisition Update
As part of AlphaFC's development, we have made significant progress in our acquisition of a 6th-tier English football club. On October 5th, we attended a match in ---------, where we met with the club's manager and chairman, and spoke with key stakeholders, including club supporters. 

Through these discussions, we have successfully established terms and are working towards formalizing a share purchase agreement with the team. This acquisition will serve as a proof of concept for AlphaFC, allowing us to issue our first Club Shares through an airdrop to fans and community members and commence a public sale via launchpad. 

These Club Shares will give fans the ability to speculate, along with decision-making influence over key team operations, such as player scouting, transfers, and more.

Following the acquisition, our focus will be on scaling AlphaFC through a SaaS model, onboarding additional teams to issue shares and implement fan voting on our platform. This model will enable AlphaFC to expand beyond football to other sports, democratizing ownership and engagement in sports at a global scale.

## Orijin 

### Description
Orijin is a blockchain-based Digital Rights Management (DRM) system designed to solve the challenges of traditional software licensing models. This solution gives software developers verifiable ownership and control by leveraging tokenization and smart contract deployment. Each game is minted as a unique NFT with a private ID to prevent piracy.

By creating a decentralized Web3 marketplace, Orijin allows games to be bought, sold, and resold securely. A game buyer can resell their game by transferring ownership of the game NFT to a new buyer, while the original developer earns a royalty fee. The reseller loses ownership of the game NFT after the sale, ensuring fair trade practices. Additionally, every time a game developer mints a new game NFT copy, a small transaction fee is incurred.

## Rheal Access

### Description
RhealAccess NFT Ticketing. This product uses the Solana blockchain as an accessible and secure database for multiple solutions, including:
• Event Ticketing. Ticketmaster is leading the market in an attempt to create a NFT-based ticketing system. After spending millions in development, they still don't have anything ready for prime time. Even if they succeed and capture the portion of the market they currently control, that leaves a sizable addressable market for the company to attack. NFT ticketing offers many advantages, including control by the ticketer for resell parameters--including the ability to prevent secondary sales and the automatic way to capture a portion of any secondary sales, whether an intermediary party (like Stubhub) is used or not. Turnkey solutions can be delivered to any type of customer of any size.
• Identification. Company identification systems are a huge market. We can deliver solutions that don't require physical badges. Employees can use an app on their phones that provides more security than current systems. This product can be used for similar systems, including driver licenses, passports, or other verified identifications. These NFTs can store any biometric information that customers may require. Capabilities can scale over time. The cost of this system is very low. We can create one billion identity NFTs for less than $100,000.
• Identity Fraud Elimination. Fraud can come from forged documents, such as property titles, and hacked vendor databases. Just this week, an article was published with the headline: "Ticketmaster says customers' credit card information is affected by data breach" (CBC, July 8, 6:37pm EDT). Any legal document can be placed on-chain with full validation and transfer controls. We can use an identity NFT as login credentials to safeguard consumers' information from a possible attack.
• Privacy Control. Perhaps the biggest drawback to using the blockchain for document storage is its public nature. The company can employ encryption and other proprietary technologies to protect any content (data, image, video, etc.) in these NFTs. This will give owners complete control over who can see these documents' contents. For example, you could show your property's title to a specific bank for a particular time period for an equity loan application and withhold the information from everyone else. Rules can be implemented to give law enforcement or other entities access under certain conditions.
• Value-Add. The tickets can be used to open other doors, literal or virtual. New ecosystems can be created before the event, during, or after. Digital collectibles and photos can be added or related to the ticket. Ticketers can send digital items directly to the ticket holders. This capability also applies to the Identification NFTs. For example, if my company has a group outing to a major league baseball game, these tickets can be distributed automatically and tied to company identification. The employees receive the tickets in their ID app, and the company will be confident that only those intended to use the tickets can access them.
• Communications. Issuers can use RhealAccess NFTs as a basis for secure communications with NFT holders. This capability can open many new valuable ways to narrowcast or do bidirectional messaging. For example, If I buy a ticket for a concert then resell it to a friend, the concert promoter can send communications directly to my friend to ask about their concert experience--all that without my friend needing to register on the promoter's website.

## Galeristas

### Description
The Galeristas is the art world's operating system (RWA).  We empower artists, gallerists, curators, and collectors by providing tools for managing artwork, issuing digital certificates, and tracking provenance via NFTs.  By streamlining gallery operations and offering collectors a new way to manage and discover art, The Galeristas aims to bring the traditional art market into the digital age, creating lasting value for all participants.

While the art world is filled with creativity and innovation, it still needs to be updated regarding artwork, provenance, and sales. We address this gap by simplifying how artists, gallerists, curators, and collectors interact with one another.

The core of what we’re building is a system that provides galleries with tools to manage their inventory, track provenance, and offer collectors a way to manage their portfolios quickly. For artists, once a work is sold, they are cut off from any future value generated by that artwork, which doesn’t align with how value is treated in other creative industries like music or film. We use smart contracts to ensure artists can participate in their creative legacy. 

The global art market is estimated at around $65 billion annually, but most of that market activity happens in secondary sales, where neither artists nor galleries participate. This is where we believe The Galeristas can bring value—not by disrupting the market, but by creating tools that allow more players to participate in ways they haven’t been able to before. We’re focusing on building features that make sense for galleries and collectors first and then expanding those to artists who want more control over their work post-sale.

Why Solana?

By embedding itself more deeply into the art world, Solana can gain credibility as a reliable platform for managing high-value assets in creative industries. Blockchain adoption is still early in the art market. Still, the opportunity to become the go-to infrastructure for NFTs tied to physical assets—whether paintings, sculptures, or other art forms—is enormous. For Solana, becoming a trusted layer for creating and maintaining physical art NFTs creates a strong case for long-term adoption across new sectors.

## Vehicular Control V2

### Description
Vehicular Control is an innovative platform that uses Solana blockchain technology to provide transparency and security in vehicle registration and tracking in Mexico. The project aims to combat corruption in the sale of stolen cars by offering an immutable system where each vehicle and its owner are securely and verifiably registered. With features such as the generation of private keys and certificates for owners, Vehicular Control ensures that only legitimate owners can make changes to the registry, protecting both the user and the automotive market.

### Details

- **Country:** Mexico
- **Additional Info:** Our project, Vehicular Control, addresses a critical issue in Mexico: corruption and the lack of transparency in the automotive market. Each year, thousands of stolen cars are rebranded and returned to the market with falsified documents, causing massive financial losses. Our solution, based on Solana’s blockchain, provides an immutable and secure platform that ensures the integrity of each vehicle's history, from its manufacture to future transactions. This not only protects legitimate owners but also instills confidence in a system that currently suffers from uncertainty.

The adoption of our platform will not only solve a local problem but also drive blockchain usage in real-world applications. By integrating a technology as fast and scalable as Solana, we ensure thousands of daily queries, benefiting all users while enhancing blockchain infrastructure on a massive scale. Vehicular Control is a unique opportunity to be part of a technological revolution that will impact the economy, security, and public trust.

## Luna AI: Save time and reduce error. Simplify your DeFi strategy with Blinks and AI.

### Description
While other bots might take over financial operations—raising concerns about handing full control to an AI—Luna leverages advanced semantics to understand your intentions without overstepping boundaries. By generating actionable Blinks, Luna provides you with clear, data-driven strategies based on in-depth analysis, yet leaves the execution entirely in your hands.

Luna's Blink editor enhances this approach by allowing you to create and customize these widgets, effectively letting you white-label your own Blinks.

Note:

For the Radar hackathon, we significantly expanded Luna AI's features and functionality. We developed the strategy analyzer, added the ability to create limit orders, and essentially built what makes Luna AI an MVP today. Prior to the hackathon, Luna was just a chat platform that supported swapping and transferring SOL without even saving messages in a database.

## DeDocs

### Description
Problem Statement:

Traditional document management systems lack transparency, are vulnerable to tampering, and struggle with secure remote signing. This leads to fraud risks, inefficient processes, and challenges in verifying document authenticity.

Why we're building DeDocs:

To solve this issue, we have built DeDocs, which is a Decentralized Document Management App built on Solana using Solana's React Native SDK. Our app leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for document storage, signing, and verification. We're revolutionizing critical document management for the digital age. Users can upload critical documents (e.g., property papers) directly to the Solana blockchain.

Document owners can designate signers using the signer's Solana wallet addresses during the upload process. Designated signers can see the document in their DeDocs app when logged in with their respective wallet addresses. The signers can view and sign the document with the help of a slider button after which their signatures will be recorded on the Solana blockchain, creating an immutable proof of signing.

The app displays the signing information, including the number of signatures (signed or not signed) and signer's details along with the signer's photo. Users provide a selfie upon first launching the app. Selfies are stored on IPFS, with their hashes recorded on Solana. This feature adds a layer of identity verification to the signing process.

The app showcases all user created and user signed documents so that they can easily track the status of document signatures. Signer photos are shown to uploader at the time of adding signers, so that there is some form of KYC as to who will be signing the documents.

Our target audience are individuals and businesses handling important documents, legal professionals, real estate agencies, financial institutions, and government entities. And our long-term vision is to establish DeDocs as the global standard for decentralized document management, streamlining workflows across industries and driving wider adoption of blockchain technology in everyday document processes.

## Intellectual Property System - IPS

### Description
IPS is a platform that simplifies intellectual property protection and management for creators in the digital age. What sets IPS apart is our unique integration of blockchain technology with official IP bodies. We offer end-to-end IP management that bridges the gap between digital creation and legal protection, all while automating royalty collection through smart contracts.

### Details

- **Country:** Sierra Leone
- **Additional Info:** The IPS platform is a product from Christex Foundation’s incubator, developed for the Office of Administrator and Registrar General (OARG) in Sierra Leone. The goal is to digitise the process of creating and registering Intellectual Property (IP) in Sierra Leone, making it easier, more accessible, and more secure.

Our approach is similar to Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation, where real assets are represented on the blockchain while maintaining their legal standing in the physical world. In cases where the issuing authority isn’t fully onchain, we manage the legal process for users, ensuring they are protected and can seek damages if their IP rights are violated.

This platform has the potential to become OARG’s primary method for IP issuance in Sierra Leone. We also hope to encourage more digital artists to create, as the platform addresses their primary concern of protecting their work from theft and misuse.

By integrating seamlessly with Property Management Systems (PMS), TripFlip manages all the receivables of a hotel, providing real-time data on revenue and occupancy. This unique feature allows the platform to accurately assess the available credit for each hotel based on their receivables, making the loan issuance process faster, more efficient, and more transparent.

TripFlip not only introduces a new financing model for hotels but also creates a secondary market for reselling and trading tokenized bookings. This enables hotels to unlock liquidity, while investors and travelers can participate in trading these digital assets. The combination of direct booking services, financial products, and blockchain integration makes TripFlip a pioneering solution in the travel and hospitality sectors.

## DegenDrop

### Description
The Problem:
- Onboarding new users to crypto is the largest challenge we all have in crypto right now
- Memecoins are a great vehicle to solve this onboarding problem
- But it's a hassle to have fun with memecoins onchain: you have to set up a wallet, KYC and onramp all of which leads to a large % dropoff rate.
=>that's why I've built DegenDrop:


How It Works:
Popular memecoins get raffled daily to users for free
-for each raffle, we create and fund TipLinks (v1) with varying amounts of coins
-the TipLinks are then randomly assigned and sent to the users
-in v1 everything happens inside a telegram chat
-since telegram requires phone numbers, we can thus limit the sybil problem


How we Make it sticky:
- Make it the best arcade for users. Focus on Free Raffles + Simplest UX.
- Every round, N random users win a large payout of an assortment of Memecoins - with share button to CT to create engaging loop
- Notifications via Telegram messages for daily engagement

### Details

- **Country:** Germany
- **Additional Info:** Business Model:
I believe there's huge value in tying a wallet abstraction to a viral and sticky onboarding flow:
- Own the user experience for large numbers of consumers
- Natively integrate swaps - we can direct some % of our users' orderflow to it and charge a premium on eg memecoins swaps (typical wallet business model)
- Offer a marketing vehicle to memecoin communities which can raffle some of their tokens via our audience (creating self-sufficient raffle payouts)



Next Steps:
- Add share button 
- Improve the end-to-end UX by 10x (Onboarding + retargeting via notifs)
- Add swap integration
- Start public raffles

These plugins can range from specialized blockchain integrations and DeFi protocol interactions to advanced trading algorithms and notification systems. Developers have the flexibility to offer their plugins for free or set a monthly subscription fee, enabling them to monetize their contributions.

This open-source approach and the availability of powerful libraries empower developers to build sophisticated AI-powered chatbot applications for the cryptocurrency space.

Decentralized battery to balance power grid with home batteries.

Who
People who have a home battery or are willing to have one in the future.
People who don’t have national power grids but would like to spin up microgrids
Where
Beachhead - countries with blackouts like Ukraine with further global domination
When		Make a little roadmap for yourself- LOI, User, Story, Arch Diagram ….
As soon as I can code 😀
What
Skat Battery will help us all to move to clean energy. Battery owners will get extra incentives to sell and buy electricity from the grid and thus offset the cost of battery. Also, the grid becomes more resilient to sudden spikes in consumption. 

NB: There are Virtual Power Plants like Tesla VPP, Octopus VPP and Sonnen VPP which works in centralized manner. How to beat them with a better crypto product?
Arch Chart: https://www.figma.com/board/x21tOEqJ2zlX6zj6fLcYcM/Skat-Service-Blueprint?node-id=0-1&t=0uGLY8w1oFTdzbyD-1

Why		Why are you building it? Why is this project, this solution- important to you? 
It's a continuation of my work in energy storage within Skat Battery. 
How		What’s your general plan for Logic, how will you create the desired UX via
		Solana Anchor Programs?

## Biscuit_dexola

### Description
Biscuit is a decentralized platform that offers users the opportunity to invest in various financial NFTs/Portfolios in just a few clicks.

### Details

- **Country:** Ukraine
- **Additional Info:** https://develop.d1d7dnmgi6zj3z.amplifyapp.com

PROBLEM 
In the cryptocurrency market, new users often grapple with the challenge of understanding which coins are worth investing in and how to construct an optimal investment portfolio. During the portfolio creation process, they frequently encounter issues such as time-consuming research, the need to use various platforms for asset purchases, and the challenge of storing assets in a centralized location. These factors contribute to inconvenience and apprehension throughout the cryptocurrency investment journey.



SOLUTION  
Our team aims to develop a platform leveraging NFT technology, offering users a range of portfolio options for cryptocurrency investments. These portfolios may include low-risk assets or assets categorized into specific fields like AI, DeFi, Gaming, etc. The project team will curate and create these portfolios.

Upon selecting a particular portfolio comprising multiple assets, users can, with a single click and using the network currency, mint an NFT. This NFT will encapsulate the specified amount of assets from the chosen portfolio, which will instantly be distributed into staking/pools, enabling users to generate additional profits.

Should the need arise, users can burn their NFT, receiving funds in the form of assets from the portfolio along with staking rewards, or in network currency, depending on the option chosen during the NFT minting process.

## Shaper GAP® - Transforming Skill-building Into an Adventure

### Description
Shaper is like a game, but instead of just playing, you’re actually leveling up your real-life skills. Picture this: you’re in a vibrant virtual city where you take on challenges, solve problems, and collaborate with others. While you’re immersed in the fun, you’re learning critical skills that matter in the real world, like how to communicate effectively, think on your feet, or even lead a team.

It’s not your typical sit-and-listen type of learning—everything is interactive. You get to make choices, take action, and learn by doing. And the best part? You’ll see your progress in real-time, discovering what you’re naturally good at and improving where needed.

In a nutshell, Shaper is an adventure that helps you uncover and build essential skills, all while having a great time!

### Details

- **Country:** Argentina
- **Additional Info:** We picked this idea because, as a father of three amazing kids, I’m on a mission to leave a better world for them. I want them to grow up happy, fulfilled, and motivated, and I believe the best way to achieve that is by knowing yourself. That’s what led me to create this platform. It’s my gift to every kid and adult out there—giving them the tools to navigate this crazy world, uncover their talents, and use them wisely.

When people do what they’re naturally good at, they’re more motivated, more productive, and ultimately, happier. And happy people? They’re the ones who change the world.

Users just have to include these tags in their content to enable these experience.

Currently, Tggr as a URL transformer is live and already in mainnet and free to use. Some of the future paid features I am currently working on is the capability for users to customize their urls before sharing it, view link analytics, and the biggest one, to add their own custom tags, say for Bitget - “ggbitget”.

And these paid features can be bought utilizing popular wallets such as Bitget, Phantom, etc.

## Polyton

### Description
Telegram Mini-games are next gen memecoins. 

Polyton is a no-code Telegram Mini App games builder that allows any user to launch a game with a memecoin on Solana in less than 1 minute. 

All batteries included: referrals, quests, leaderboards, etc. Grow token’s liquidity with in-game purchases, ad revenue, sponsored quests, trading fees and liquid staking! Our MVP is integrated with Radyum and Marinad Finance.

App demo: https://t.me/polyton_app_builder_dev_bot

### Details

- **Country:** Georgia
- **Additional Info:** 🥳 Memecoins have achieved remarkable success

Pump.fun alone was able to generate more revenue than Ethereum, Tron or Solana on some days.

⚠️ Yet there are several critical challenges 

- Sniper bots capture most value. Real users are increasingly turned away because they again and again end up losing money.
- Limited growth. Memcoin platforms cannot reach the Web2 audience: a user needs a wallet and gas to start trading.
- Low capital efficiency, e.g. top memecoins have lost almost $300M in fees to locked liquidity (source: Keyrock)
- Memcoins are simple to create, but can hardly attract any attention or create any valuable IP

😍Opportunity: Telegram Mini Apps (TMAs) as New Memcoins

Unparalleled reach of Telegram mini-apps (TMAs) has allowed to bring consumer engagement with crypto to the next level. 

The numbers speak for themselves: Notcoin acquired 35M users in 3 months, Hamster kombat 150M users, 46M DAUs, Catizen: 21M users, 3M DAUs.

This enables a complete new class of assets: Mini-app games/apps are the next “memecoins” 

They are fun, casual, viral, and interactive! True attention assets.

However, while almost anyone can create a meme, Telegram mini-apps (TMAs) have a steep learning curve and require a solid technical background. As a result, the creative potential of the vast Telegram user base remains untapped. Here we are talking about millions of users who love playing Telegram tap-to-earn games and are eager to turn memes into new “clickers”.

This is where Polyton comes in.

✅ Our Solution

Polyton is an easy to use no-code Telegram Mini-App (TMA) Games builder that allows anyone to launch a game with a memecoin in several clicks.

Our vision is to empower users to build 1000s of mini-apps and make them a cultural phenomenon on Solana with ultimate onboarding: no wallet, no gas required, no apps to install.

Why?

- Simple. No coding required. No art skills needed - AI generated assets. Ready-made presets  (e.g. idle, tap, craft games). Pre-calibrated tokenomics.
- Engaging. Fun and interactive games instead of static meme images.
Evolving. Add new content
- Social. Leverage Telegram as a distribution channel

All batteries included: from referral system and leaderboard to token airdrop and trading pool launch.

What is more important: Polyton offers a positive-sum game economy for both degens and Web2 users.

Both degen traders and players contribute to the token’s liquidity:

- Want classic memcoin trading experience? Buy and sell tokens memcoin ⇒ trade fees go to token’s liquidity pool.
- Don’t feel like risking money? Climb the ranks in a free-to-play game to earn your fair share of tokens ⇒ in-game microtransactions, ads and marketing quests contribute to the token’s liquidity pool.

Note that how selling tokens or trading against other players is NOT anymore required to launch a token.

Grow your playerbase, add more content to your game, collaborate with other Web3 projects, and your token’s liquidity will organically grow!

## WatchFy

### Description
WatchFy fractionalizes luxury watches with NFT collections on Solana to allow everyone to invest in a share of a luxury watch! The purpose of WatchFy is to give everyone access to investing in an outperforming alternative asset traditionally reserved for the ultra-wealthy. The consumer and business model of WatchFy works just like Masterworks, where users can view a marketplace for shares of luxury watches available for purchase.

### Details

- **Country:** Canada
- **Additional Info:** We are a fully bootstrapped team passionate about giving users access to investing like the top 0.1%. This is why we decided to build WatchFy. We are currently finalizing our closed beta and accepting users to our waitlist at the link below. We will be continuing to develop and grow WatchFy as well as adding unique incentives and aspects of gamification/governance to the platform to foster a community of users who love fractionalization and luxury watches!

From a user's high-level perspective, WatchFy can be broken down into 5 steps:
1. WatchFy finds an investment-worthy watch, purchases it, and becomes the physical custodian
2. WatchFy creates an NFT collection on Solana that is backed by the luxury watch (1 NFT = 1 share)
3. Users buy however many NFTs/shares they want to buy
4. (To be developed) Users can trade their shares in a watch on our secondary marketplace
5. WatchFy sells the physical watch and returns the proceeds to NFT-holders/shareholders

## Seconds

### Description
Empowering savings through digital dollars and high-yield opportunities.

Throughout history, savings have symbolized financial security and stability. From ancient practices of hoarding precious metals to the establishment of modern banking systems, preserving wealth has always been a priority for the fortunate.

Yet, today, millions lack access to basic savings options. In many countries, people are excluded from financial institutions, and even where accounts exist, the returns often fail to keep pace with inflation. As interest rates decline, the potential for savings to serve as a reliable means of wealth preservation diminishes.

Instead of focusing on long-term financial security, individuals find themselves trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. With little room for error or unexpected expenses, many turn to trading memecoins in hopes of quick gains—only to face devastating losses that further erode their financial stability.

But what if we could change this narrative? Digital dollars offer a unique opportunity to transform how individuals save and grow their wealth. Unlike traditional savings accounts that yield minimal returns, digital dollars can provide higher yields through compounded interest, allowing savers to see their money work harder for them.


We are committed to making savings work for everyone. Our platform offers access to savings, high-yield lending, complex strategies used by professional traders, and investment opportunities in liquid assets and private companies.

## stream.gift

### Description
Tip & support your favorite streamers via Solana. Send SOL to streamers on Twitch, Kick, YouTube, X, etc on their personalized stream.gift profiles.

Many streaming platforms and creators depend on crowdsourced or crowdfunded support from their audiences. However, most crowdfunding solutions involve traditional payments, leading to challenges such as fraudulent donations & chargebacks, high fees from streaming platforms, and complications with international banking payments for different regions. Despite these major problems for nearly a decade, livestream crowdfunding is still largely successful. Some effort in has been made to PoC crypto payments for streamers, but are generally a low TRL score, and a market ready product to solve these problems for streamers is yet to arrive.

You can send a streamer a donation easily on Solana, (ex. twitch.gift/nickmura2), and a streamer can listen for these donation alerts on their livestream via OBS, which can be announced & notified live. Users can also customize their alerts TTS, and color/gradient to be displayed. Donations are handled via a custodial HD wallet (hierarchical wallet) and non-custodial withdrawals to enable both Web3 wallet transactions (Phantom, Glow) and mobile/external transactions sent from an exchange or external wallet.

stream.gift was also built frequently at Build Station Toronto alongside Superteam Canada over the last week, to gain as much insight & feedback from mentors & Solana community members prior to submission.

Post-hackathon, we are still developing our GTM strategy. We already have a few streamers using our platform and plan to promote stream.gift on Twitter.

## Decentralised Secure Collaborations

### Description
DeSC is a project focused on enabling secure, encrypted communication and collaboration between parties. Its fundamental feature is an encrypted messaging system, used for discussions between initiators and acceptors in a collaboration process. The entire collaboration process is divided into multiple 'atomic levels' with the help of Artificial Intelligence. A moderator set from a moderator universe is selected where each subset of moderators only overlooks one atomic level, thus ensuring the privacy, transparency, and decentralised properties. This technique is used in Blockchain first time ever according to our knowledge. While the messaging aspect is centralized, the final agreements are signed and stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and immutability. DeSC also caches collaboration data for easy access and reference during communication, creating a smooth flow of information. The project aims to blend the convenience of centralized communication with the security and trustlessness of blockchain technology. The myriad usecases include from collaboration for tangible assets (e.g., supply chain) and digital assets (e.g., transfering NFTs) to collaboration for abstract assets (e.g., social media collaboration, freelance technical product development collaboration, etc.).

### Details

- **Country:** Germany
- **Additional Info:** Project Roadmap:

Enough with the "killer" titles—let’s talk about the real potential behind what we’re building at Zelf.

At first glance, it might seem like we’re just developing another crypto wallet. But we’re doing something far more impactful. We’re aiming for mass adoption by providing everyone in the crypto space with a seamless way to secure their assets with ZelfProofs, while maintaining complete control over their data.

Here’s how Zelf works in 3 simple steps:

Pick your Zelf name – Users choose a unique name like miguel.zelf or john.zelf. This becomes their key to everything.

Create or import your wallet – With your Zelf name, you can either create a new wallet or import an existing one. Your ZelfProof—a privacy-preserving encrypted representation of your data—is created and stored as a QR code inside ZNS (stored on IPFS). No sensitive information is ever stored; only encrypted data is saved for your security.

Retrieve and interact – When you need to access your wallet, just search your Zelf name (john.zelf), and decrypt your ZelfProof with your face + password (optional). This allows you to retrieve your wallet’s 12-word phrase, interact with smart contracts, and once done, you can delete the decrypted content from your device, leaving no trace behind.

This simplicity is what’s capturing everyone’s attention—no need to remember seed phrases or deal with complex hardware wallets. You always stay in control, and with ZelfProofs, your data remains private and secure, safeguarded with powerful encryption.

Why Solana?

We see Solana’s speed and scalability as the perfect foundation to integrate ZNS and ZelfProofs into decentralized applications (dApps). By using ZelfProofs through ZNS, developers can provide users with seamless authentication and secure wallet management, while dApps benefit from frictionless logins, identity verification, and transaction signing, all without compromising security.

This solution is particularly effective for DeFi and NFT platforms, solving the challenge of balancing security with ease of use. With ZelfProofs, users enjoy passwordless, secure experiences, and developers get peace of mind knowing that sensitive data is never stored, only encrypted.

We’re also addressing broader challenges like multi-chain compatibility. Whether on Solana, Ethereum, or any emerging chain, ZNS and ZelfProofs enable secure, cross-chain interactions, allowing users to move assets and verify identities across blockchains—effortlessly.

For developers and enterprises, integrating ZNS and ZelfProofs offers new levels of security and ease for their applications, whether in DeFi, NFTs, or DAOs. For users, it’s a powerful, user-friendly way to manage their crypto without the complexity of traditional wallets.

### Details

- **Country:** Colombia
- **Additional Info:** Alright, at Zelf, we initially focused on providing encryption solutions for Web2 companies. However, recognizing the growing demand in the crypto space, we expanded our offerings to include ZelfProofs—our privacy-preserving face verification system—and integrated encryption for both Web2 and Web3 users. Now, we're aiming to simplify onboarding for crypto users with the Zelf Name Service (ZNS), leveraging IPFS to securely store metadata and ZelfProofs within QR Codes. This enables users to back up and restore their ZelfProofs easily without the need for remembering complex seed phrases, bringing a more user-friendly experience to crypto.

Link to our mvp : https://www.solutiofi.io/synthesis
Link to our hackathon work : https://solutio-fi-io.vercel.app/dapp

INFORMATION:
We started developing Synthesis a little before the official two-month window, specifically launching an MVP with three features: Bulk Swap, Account Closure, and Burn. However, these were preliminary steps, not our core concept. : Defi Manager. For the hackathon, we focused on building this feature, and simultaneously worked on the Spread feature to complement the existing Merge (used to be called swap on the MVP). The future of Synthesis lies in continually expanding DeFi capabilities and adding new features. We’ve built on top of our MVP to deliver a comprehensive solution for DeFi users. We wanted to be transparent about this early work and clarify that our hackathon efforts were centered on expanding our core functionality to deliver a more comprehensive tool

## Sol Saver

### Description
Sol Saver is a unique metaverse experience that blends immersive gameplay with social impact, built on the fast and scalable Solana blockchain. In Sol Saver, players can explore beautifully crafted environments, including a futuristic cyberpunk city, a serene village, an ancient forest, and a medieval town. These richly designed worlds offer a range of interactive experiences, from exploring and socializing with other players to engaging in exciting mini-games.

What sets Sol Saver apart is its play-to-donate model. When players participate in mini-games, they encounter short, non-intrusive ads. The revenue generated from these ads is then donated to various NGOs, allowing players to contribute to social causes without spending their own money. This turns typical metaverse entertainment into a force for good, combining gaming fun with philanthropy.

Additionally, Sol Saver leverages Solana's low transaction fees and high throughput, ensuring smooth gameplay, fast transactions, and secure digital asset ownership. Players can also own, trade, and showcase unique NFTs, such as avatars, skins, land, and accessories, all within the metaverse. By building on Solana, Sol Saver ensures a decentralized and scalable experience that can handle a large number of players while supporting a robust in-game economy.

In summary, Sol Saver merges the excitement of metaverse exploration and gaming with the power of charitable giving, making it a platform where entertainment meets real-world impact.

### Details

- **Country:** India
- **Additional Info:** Live Demo Link : https://solsaver.vercel.app/


Multiplayer Experience: Sol Saver was initially built as a fully multiplayer metaverse, allowing users to explore and interact in real time. The multiplayer aspect has been smooth, creating a dynamic and socially engaging experience for players. However, as part of our ongoing effort to enhance gameplay, we integrated Magic Blocks using Solana's Unity SDK, aiming to add more interactive and puzzle-based elements.

Magic Blocks Development Delay: Magic Blocks are designed to bring dynamic, blockchain-powered mechanics to the game, allowing players to interact with puzzle blocks that can change based on smart contract conditions or in-game events. By leveraging Solana's Unity SDK, we aimed to create unique game elements that would reflect the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain technology.

However, during development, we encountered some technical challenges when trying to sync these Magic Blocks across all players in the multiplayer environment. The real-time interactions between players and the blockchain updates weren't aligning perfectly, causing delays in the feature’s implementation. The primary challenge lies in maintaining efficient on-chain state synchronization for these blocks while ensuring smooth gameplay for all users.

While the multiplayer functionality of Sol Saver is fully operational, we’ve temporarily delayed the release of Magic Blocks until we resolve these synchronization issues. Our team is actively working to overcome these challenges, and we’re excited to roll out Magic Blocks soon, which will add a deeper level of strategic interaction to the metaverse. Once complete, players will be able to solve puzzles and unlock new features powered by Solana's blockchain, directly within the metaverse.

## Proxytheon Finance 

### Description
Have stagnant NFTs in your wallet? What if there was a place you could put any NFTs value to work for you? What if there was a place where an NFTs value could be backed by another NFT or another token in a paired liquidity pool? A place where an NFTs value could be locked up for LP rewards, where its value gets unlocked and pooled together through auto LP rewards restaking which in turn adds value to the NFT? And others could stake tokens as liquidity providers to any NFTs liquidity pool? What if you could utilize you NFTs value to earn rewards through borrowing or lending? A place where you could buy,sell, and trade NFTs as a whole or as fractionalized tokens to investors/ collectors?

Introducing Proxytheon Finance

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** I hope the presentation goes through. Unfortunately I no longer have the time to redo it and hope maybe reading this can give you a quick description of my project. Proxytheon Finance. The idea behind the project is to create paired token Liquidity pools using an NFT's Floor Price (atleast) value as collateral against my projects native Token. Rewards from LP tokens are not earned until the equal amount of value has been accumulated to repay any Loaned tokens value. Until then any reward earned is split in half, 50% towards loaned tokens, 50% into a Reserve Liquidity Pool. After payment 100% of earned rewards are able to be claimed from Liquidity Providers. This is a new NFT + DeFi Platform aimed to generate liquidity for blockchains in need during busy transactions and friction. I have a hybrid Consensus Protocol that enables longterm investments and multiple rewards to be earned through Teirs or Levels, with an option to prestige. I also have a Credit Score/ grading system created for this hybrid Consensus, i call Proof of Action, which utilizes aspects from both PoW and PoS protocols. I am a one man team and have tried to put this together the best I could. I have multiple ideas for blockchain projects. This is NFTs value that is stuck in stasis brought back to life and used as liquidity. I'd love the chance to pitch my other ideas once day. Hopefully this worked out better than I feel it did lol.  Anyways I really appreciate the opportunity and wont let obstacles slow me down. I'll make waves throughout the crypto space one day lol Thanks again, Tom Harrington - Proxytheon Finance - Founder

## Transaction Indexer for Solana Raydium and pump.fun with direct access to the Clickhouse database with full capabilities

### Description
Access to a real-time updated database of all transactions on the Solana DEX Raydium and pump.fun.
Supports swaps with wrapped Solana and swaps made through Telegram bots

Access method: REST API or login/password access to the Clickhouse database

Server address: https://chess-beta.api.web3engineering.co.uk:28123
login: readonly_radardemo1
password: eragyuhjgrevs5771

## Verve

### Description
Verve aims to create open-source embedded smart wallet infrastructure using account abstraction and ZK compression.
Instead of using multiparty key management schemes, it utilizes a guardian model, which allows users to assign any number of guardians to their smart account, with different roles and levels of privileges.
Creating a smart account with Verve costs only transaction fees, thanks to Light Protocol's ZK compression. This allows apps of any size to offer new users an embedded wallet at next to no cost.
And, since Verve's smart accounts are entirely onchain, they will exist for as long as Solana does, without the risk of external service providers cancelling their services.

## Astralane

### Description
Astralane delivers unparalleled Solana infrastructure, combining cost-effective high-speed indexing with ultra-low latency middleware. Our indexing solution crunches terabytes of data in seconds at a fraction of traditional costs, while our middleware, developed by veteran high-frequency engineers, offers the fastest real-time Solana data access in the market. We're not just another infrastructure provider - we're the performance-obsessed partner that serious Solana teams trust to stay ahead of the curve.

### Details

- **Country:** Canada
- **Additional Info:** Questions and Answers:

Q1: Why did we say "Saying Solana infrastructure sucks"?
A1: We apologize for the overgeneralized statement "Solana infrastructure sucks." This was an inaccurate representation of our views. We meant to highlight specific challenges in high-speed indexing and low-latency middleware for advanced use cases, which led us to develop our solutions. We recognize and respect the excellent work of existing Solana infrastructure providers.

Q2: How do we differ?
A2: For low-latency middleware, we simplify the complex process of setup, management, and optimization. Our multi-broadcast technology, leveraging kernel bypass techniques, aggregates optimal routes to land transactions faster, while we handle SwQoS bidding, client updates, and infrastructure management. In high-speed indexing, we've developed bloom filters to reduce traversal and egress costs. We work with dedicated partners who handle IDLs and discriminators on-the-fly, addressing this common pain point. Additionally, we offer external data enrichment with failsafe mechanisms and outlier filters, overcoming limitations of WASM-based indexers.


Q3: Team Background - HFT side?
A3: One of our Founding engineers is a veteran from Tradfi HFT company - ex Wintermute, Citadel, DRW. We understand the need for discretion in this industry and have intentionally been subtle about our specific experiences. We're leveraging this expertise to create solutions tailored for on-chain market making and other high-performance applications. 


Q4: Our Target market and distribution strategy?
A4: Our primary targets are advanced DeFi protocols, on-chain market makers, high speed TG bots and data analytics firms requiring high-performance infrastructure. We're leveraging our team's industry connections and focusing on direct outreach to potential clients. We're also exploring partnerships with existing Solana ecosystem players to expand our reach.


Q5: Our business model and how do we plan to generate revenue?
A5: We're primarily focused on a SaaS model, offering our high-speed indexing and low-latency middleware services to developers, DeFi protocols, and trading firms. Our pricing will be based on usage and performance tiers. Here are some examples of our current products and its costs:

A5.1: Currently our High speed indexers are already live you can try spinning up an index on https://a4.astralane.io/create-index. These run on quite cost efficient setups which are super easy to manage and each program run costs us only about 200$ for initial run and since we use a lite setup to active fill thats very minimal in cost. 

A5.2: We have also built out a MeV dashboard accessible here https://a4.astralane.io/mev and a Account indexer, you can try it out using docs here https://indexer.astralane.io/api-docs. We currently have a couple of clients already interested in getting permissioned access to this on a subscription model for a wide range of requirements spanning from customized data dumps and synthesised reports. 

A5.3: The DeX PnL is already live and currently being used in prod by a couple of our DEX partners, Copy trading bot providers, AI and Analytics partners. Streaming over 100+ accounts per day with full daily indexed historical data. It costs about 200$ to historically traverse around 100 accounts which makes the account indexing cost around 2-3$/mo/user. We are currently working on cutting this down even further by reducing our external dependancies.

A5.4; Our low latency middleware is also currently live serving clients in Frankfurt and Tokyo serving ultra high data streaming speeds and super fast txn confirmation times (1 slot avg) - we currently have two big HFT firms onboard already can provide a colo instance for anyone. Our setup is also quite lite weight compared to traditional RPC clients as we use lite implementations which are tailor built for different vertical needs.

## Chakra Drive

### Description
a free-to-use, end-to-end encrypted file store

your files, your way

powered by solana, irys, and lit

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** Link: https://drive.chakra.network/

Chakra Labs is a new company with the goal of building a community owned data economy. More on this 🔜

Why we built Chakra Drive: Even in Western nations, censorship is a real concern. 
Ex: Eric Schmidt gave a talk last month, citing work-life balance as a reason for Google's deteriorating lead in AI. This talk has since vanished from the internet.  

https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1etto3y/former_google_ceo_eric_schmidts_stanford_talk/

With Chakra Drive, you can now store these files forever - free up to 10GBs, thanks for our friends at Irys Network. Moreover, you can share to Twitter with Blinks 👀 (powered by @saydialect) with one click.

Eric's honest conversation lives on here ⤵️

https://drive.chakra.network/share/iDU-C6Lf_6

Truly uncensorable media requires a decentralized file store - we believe deeply in a future where users own their digital storage footprint. 

Other nice nerd features:
- Out of the box integration with Tiplink - a Dropbox level consumer experience with login with Google
- 100% gasless experience. You don't need any Solana / USDC / etc to start using the application.

## AdX.so - Next generation, decentralized ad exchange

### Description
AdX.so is a next generation decentralized ad exchange and ad network, built on a use-case optimized SVM. The model enables realtime (encrypted blind auction) bidding to serve targeted digital ads to a website or application's audience. The whole process is proven back to the Solana L1 for validation and settlement between advertisers and publishers.
Our hackathon submission focused on the SVM and exchange model at the centre of network. The broader vision is to also develop next generation solutions for identity, attribution and targeting. Doing so in a way that is privacy preserving and enabling data self-sovereignty, and for individuals to participate in the value created. We believe audience/end-users should be able to participate in the network's value creation throug opt-in for targeting and ad serving, for example through DePIN/Grass-inspired browser plugin

## SolSignal.xyz

### Description
SolSignal is a super easy-to-use alert system for Solana onchain events. Receive emails (SMS, push and more to come) when a wallet transacts, a balance rises above or falls below a certain amount, an NFT is minted or transferred, etc.

### Details

- **Country:** United Kingdom
- **Additional Info:** SolSignal.xyz allows you to configure alerts for Solana onchain events, such as a wallet transacting, a wallet balance falling below or rising above a certain amount, an NFT being minted etc.  

SolSignal is fully functional now and live at SolSignal.xyz. It currently supports email alerts and will be extended to SMS, push notifications, WhatsApp and more. While currently only supporting wallet transaction alerts, further alert types will be introduced in time.  As well, SolSignal wlll introduce an API so that other developers can make use of it.

The business model is based on a SaaS tiered fremium model, with a selection of subscription options including a free tier and enteprise tiers to come. Features and alert limits will be factorred into the plans, and both B2C and B2B models will be supported.

There is a real market need for monitoring wallets and being notified of transactions as consumers and businesses want to be able to follow certain onchain activity. Consumers want to follow whales, friends, family, etc and businesses often need to monitor the walllets in their portfolios. An example of this is at my current employer, fan3, where we need to monitor the various wallets we use for gas sponsorred minting to ensure the balances don't get too low and users can no longer mint NFTs. There are some products that try to do this for the Solana ecosystem, but they are mostly targetted at traders (i.e. sniper bots), and are hard to use, often requiring regex or even coding knowledge. SolSignal.xyz will always be the simplest, easiest and fastest way to configure Solana alerts, largely targetted at non-technical people.

SolSignal was built by Richard Rauser over the past few weeks as a side project. He is currently the CTO of the web3 fan engagement platform, www.fan3.io, where he has architected and led the team in developing more than 15 apps. He has been building digital products and leading teams for more than 25 years. He has worked the full gamut of tech from front end to backend, big tech to startups.  Richard has a very broad network from his publc speaking and work at over 2 dozen different tech companies, and so can easily enlist a team when the time is right. Learn more about him at:
https://www.richardrauser.xyz 

In addition to the solsignal-dapp repo added to the project, a separate cloud functions repo for the backend can be found here:

## Ripe

### Description
Ripe enables individuals to pay with crypto wherever fiat-based payment and e-wallet QRs are accepted.  In remittance and stablecoin-heavy Southeast Asia, QR payment systems are a more dominant payment rail than credit cards.  

For Radar, we built a "Universal QR Scanner SDK for Portal" capable of scanning and paying to any crypto wallet address QR, any Solana Pay QR, and notably, any fiat payment or e-wallet QR.  In the case of fiat payment QRs, users pay in crypto, but settle in fiat.  That means customers building wallets with Portal can have their end-users' crypto accepted at millions of vendors across ASEAN.  

This channel-partnership distribution model is a new GTM exploration for Ripe, but hotly received.  We will be collaborating with Circle and its programmable wallets team to host a showcase in Bangkok, Thailand in November '24.

It focuses on automating and scaling web3 community operations through decentralized AI agents. These agents provide 24/7 community support, moderation, and data management, offering infinite scalability without human intervention. Gentic’s decentralized AI ensures data privacy and security through encrypted dynamic NFTs (dNFTs), addressing issues in Web2 like self-custody and high availability. The project lowers the barriers to AI adoption by abstracting complexity and reducing operational costs for web3 communities.

Beta Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15h1wIGB3wt-zmjV7_d8-UdzOmm7JsYHj/view?usp=sharing

In addition to dNFTs, Gentic.ai will be working on a double Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) system, further enhancing the decentralization and scalability of AI operations. This system will allow for even more efficient and secure AI management, creating a robust foundation for decentralized AI solutions​ on top of $SOLANA

## Svelte - Solana Wallet Adapter

### Description
The Solana svelte adapter is a full port + improvement of the Solana Wallet Adapter for React, The currently used version "Svelte-On-Solana" has been long-dead and was out of feature parity compared to the React version, which caused a lot of developers to rely on building apps using React-based frameworks.

This changes that, Developers are now able to build highly reactive, performant, and lightweight web apps using Svelte 5/Sveltekit.

Aside from cleaning up the code, making it more performant, and rewriting most parts for Svelte 5:

- The UI for connecting wallets is fully revamped, Works on Desktop + Mobile with swipeable modals, Adaptive UI, and Can be fully customized and branded with tailwind classes + CSS.
- Tailwind compatible!
- Improved type safety.
- Adding helpful utilities for developers in the code to make it easier to do most common tasks.
- The latest version is built on The Web3JS 2.0 Build, Which brings the final bundle size from +700kb to only 32kb! And is highly performant.

The goal is to make the Svelte version easier for developers to use and going beyond the features of the react version, such as making easier functions to subscribe to onchain events ala RainbowKit, this helps developers move fast and build on a framework that's easier to maintain and scale.

Future Features:
- Built in Sign-In/Authentication.
- Helpers for NFTs, user profiles.
- Web3 Passkeys.

## MegaNews - NFT based Reward Platform for MegaWrap Customers&Partners

### Description
The upcoming platform MegaNews will start as a reward system for clients of MegaWrap, a company with 15 years of experience, offering discounts for services like vehicle wrapping. However, it will soon evolve into a multi-trigger powerhouse, blending partners and franchise opportunities with a loyalty-building system rooted in tokenization and NFTs. This will not be just any loyalty program—it will challenge the status quo, targeting those who look down on the masses while only catering to the corrupted financial elite. Start with us, and even banks will envy you. Trust the Wrap! MegaWrap!

### Details

- **Country:** Poland
- **Additional Info:** The planned platform aims to connect the real world with the Web 3.0 ecosystem and cryptocurrencies, providing Mega Oklejanie customers with an innovative way to obtain discounts and rewards. At the first stage, users will register on the platform, where after completing the vehicle wrapping service, they will be able to receive further rewards, where the rest will be blocked for various products and services. The platform will be expanded with NFT integration, which will allow users to receive much better rewards for possession and participate in Solana projects, such as whitelists or NFT purchases. The goal is to create a network of partners, where each of them will offer discounts available on the platform, as well as the development of a loyalty system based on tokens and NFTs, which will benefit both customers and business partners. We assume a situation in which our customers will be ready to buy a token worth e.g. $ 500 or more as the platform develops, because the return of rewards, the possibility of participating in the income of some areas of the company will be a very good argument for them.

## Corpus DAO

### Description
"Corpus DAO is a mobile application designed to provide a user-friendly platform for DAOs and their members to interact with each other seamlessly.

## Pixel

### Description
At the core of the $PIXEL project is our interactive digital canvas, where every user can leave their mark by painting pixels. Here’s the catch – each pixel costs 1 $PIXEL tokens, and with every pixel you paint or repaint, those tokens are burned. This means that as more people participate, the supply of $PIXEL decreases, making it a deflationary token.

## BlockBound

### Description
"BlockBound is an innovative web application designed for rental property payment management. The goal of the application is to streamline payment requests and transactions by eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or centralized platforms. To achieve this, BlockBound leverages a decentralized approach to data management using a popular Javascript library.

Rather than relying on a central database to store all platform data, BlockBound allows users to store data locally on their devices. Data can be shared across devices on the network by setting up relays.

The sign-up process is simple and straightforward. Users can choose to sign up as landlords or renters. Once signed up, landlords can add their properties and invite tenants to those properties with ease. Sending an email invitation is all it takes for a tenant to become a part of the property.

Depending on the rent cycle set up for the property, tenants can make payments directly through the application. Additionally, landlords can make ad hoc payment requests to tenants as needed.

BlockBound is a fully decentralized application, ensuring that it is available anywhere without being reliant on server availability. This democratizes rental payment management for all users while protecting their personal data."

## Solpipe

### Description
Boost Validators and MEV Earnings with Solpipe.

MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) is a massive and growing market, but its potential remains untapped for most traders. Accessing and utilizing MEV currently requires sophisticated expertise and expensive validator infrastructure. This limits participation to a small group of specialized traders while validators struggle to fully maximize their earnings.

Solpipe's "MEV Host,” a geyser plugin run by Validators, gives traders access to MEV on Solana. It's a specialized tool that allows trading bots to deploy directly in the validator, achieving the lowest latency possible.

Solpipe provides a decentralized auction for available workers in the MEV Host and connects traders directly to validators. Our approach allows traders to:

       * Deploy MEV bots without their own Validator:  Rent  a spot in a validator to run bot (written in a preferred language)
       * Access global validator networks: Connect to validators globally optimizing bots based on validator leaderboards.
       * Access Low-Latency Updates: Achieve real-time chain state by running their bot directly within the validator.

Solpipe empowers validators to:
       * Maximize validator earnings: Offer MEV hosting services and generate additional revenue from traders.
       * Increase network participation: Open your validator to a wider range of traders, contributing to a more diverse and active Solana ecosystem.

Solpipe is the key to unlocking the full potential of MEV on Solana, making it more accessible to a wider range of participants, and empowering both traders and validators to thrive within the ecosystem.

## Clink

### Description
Clink is LST that takes your onchain spending into credit for calculating your rewards, with partnership with crypto payment apps.

### Details

- **Country:** Singapore
- **Additional Info:** Do you know how credit card rewards are generated? Do you know that some of the rewards are actually indirectly paid by the less wealthy and less educated consumers? 

Traditional credit card rewards is tricky, it opens up more privilege and more premium rewards to those who are already more wealthy. The less affluent consumers have less access to credit cards. Even though they are paying for the same expenses, they are not enjoying the rewards like the more wealthy consumers do. Even if some of them are aware of the benefit of credit card, it doesn't mean they are able to get one. They probably won't pass the Credit Score Check and Income Check conducted by the bank. 

Clink is here to solve this issue. By utilizing the LST mechanism on Solana, Clink allows everyone to enjoy payment rewards with no background check and no unfair treatment. You get amount of rewards with a direct proportion to your spending amount. Just like other LSTs, Clink's price increase as a form of rewarding holders with yield. But also unlike other LSTs, Clink has a staking pool that gives additional awards to consumers who spend onchain with their most prefer crypto payment app. 

The more you spend, the more rewards you get.

Clink has the vision to be the largest cash back and rewards platform on chain, that creates a positive feedback on creating a deeply binded Spend & Rewards loop.

## Solstice

### Description
Solstice: Your One-Click Crypto Companion! 🌟

Unlock the world of Solana tokens effortlessly with Solstice—your Telegram bot for seamless crypto investments! Say goodbye to complex exchanges and hello to instant fiat-to-SOL purchases, smart token swaps, and hassle-free Dollar-Cost Averaging. Get real-time price alerts and execute trades with just a tap! Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, Solstice makes investing in Solana tokens fun and accessible. Dive into the future of crypto—join the Solstice revolution today! 🚀✨

### Details

- **Country:** India
- **Additional Info:** Solstice: One-Click Telegram Bot for Solana Token Purchases

Problem Statement
Solstice addresses the complexities and barriers faced by individuals seeking to invest in Solana tokens. By integrating a fiat on-ramp solution and a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator within a user-friendly Telegram interface, the bot makes crypto investments accessible and efficient.

Key Features

1. Seamless Fiat-to-SOL On-Ramping  
   Solstice enables users to purchase Solana (SOL) tokens directly with fiat currencies (e.g., USD, EUR) through the Telegram bot. The process is straightforward:
   - Users select their currency and specify the amount.
   - The bot processes the transaction using a reliable on-ramp service, such as Mercuryo, and deposits SOL directly into the user’s wallet within Telegram.  
   This streamlined approach eliminates the need for users to navigate complex exchanges or manage crypto addresses, significantly enhancing accessibility for beginners.

2. Integration with Major Solana DEX Aggregators for Token Swaps
   Once users acquire SOL, they may wish to exchange it for other Solana-based tokens (e.g., USDC, SRM, RAY). Solstice utilizes a DEX aggregator, such as Jupiter, to identify and execute the best swap rates across multiple decentralized exchanges.  
   For example, if a user wants to swap SOL for USDC, the bot efficiently compares prices from various DEXs and facilitates the swap at the most favorable rate, ensuring optimal value for users.

3. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Functionality
   The DCA feature allows users to invest a fixed amount in a token at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly), mitigating the impact of price volatility.  
   For instance, a user may set up a DCA strategy to automatically invest $50 in SOL every week. The bot executes these purchases at market rates, fostering a disciplined investment approach while reducing the user’s need to monitor prices continuously.

4. Price Movement Alerts with Buy/Sell Confirmations
   Solstice actively monitors token prices and sends alerts when prices reach specified thresholds. Users can confirm buy or sell orders directly within Telegram.  
   For example, if a user sets a price alert for SOL at $30, the bot will notify them when this target is reached, prompting them with a confirmation message to proceed with the purchase.

5. User-Friendly Telegram Interface for All Operations
   All interactions occur within the Telegram platform, allowing users to manage their crypto investments without switching between multiple applications or wallets. The bot engages users in a conversational manner, simplifying the buying, swapping, and monitoring processes.  
   For instance, a user can inquire, "How much SOL do I have?" and receive an instant response detailing their balance, the current market price, and any scheduled DCA purchases.

Example Workflow

User Profile: John, a beginner crypto investor, finds traditional investment processes complicated and seeks an easier solution.

1. Fiat-to-SOL Purchase
   John opens the Telegram bot and selects the "Buy SOL" option. He enters $100 as the purchase amount. The bot uses Mercuryo to process the transaction, and within minutes, John receives the equivalent amount of SOL in his wallet.

2. Setting Up Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA
   Wanting to invest $50 in SOL weekly without constant monitoring, John instructs the bot: "Invest $50 in SOL every Monday." The bot confirms the setup, and now every Monday, $50 worth of SOL is automatically purchased and sent to John’s wallet.

3. Price Alerts
   John is interested in acquiring more SOL if the price drops to $25. He sets a price alert with the bot. A few days later, when SOL reaches $25, the bot notifies him: "SOL has dropped to $25, would you like to buy?" John confirms, and the bot completes the transaction.

4. Token Swapping
   John decides to swap 2 SOL for USDC to realize some profits. He simply requests the swap through the bot. Solstice finds the best rate using the Jupiter DEX aggregator and executes the transaction efficiently.

Throughout this entire process, John enjoys a seamless experience without ever needing to leave the Telegram interface. Solstice empowers users to navigate the crypto landscape with ease and confidence.

## Nexarb - Carbon Free Layer 2

### Description
At Nexarb, we are developing a carbon measurement system designed to significantly improve data accuracy in urban areas. The current methods, which rely on rooftop measurements, don’t reflect the true carbon footprint of cities. Our solution involves placing our device on vehicles to collect real-time data from various locations, ensuring a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the city's carbon levels. We also utilize blockchain technology to ensure transparency, as all collected data is recorded on the blockchain. Furthermore, our users benefit from owning the devices by earning points, and we plan to sell the data to companies and municipalities who require reliable carbon measurements.

### Details

- **Country:** Turkey
- **Additional Info:** I’m Doğukan, a fullstack developer with 5 years of experience, 3 of which have been focused on blockchain. I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree at the Technical University of Munich, working on a thesis aimed at improving the accuracy of carbon measurement in cities. Together with my professors and a sustainability consultant, we are transforming this thesis into a product intended for municipal use.

At Nexarb, we’ve developed a carbon measurement device that can be placed on vehicles to collect real-time, accurate data across different locations. Unlike traditional rooftop measurements, which don’t reflect the true carbon footprint of a city, our device captures data from the ground level. It can also collect different types of environmental data. The collected data is consensus-verified across multiple devices and then recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and reliability.

Our strategy revolves around a B2B model where we sell data collected by our users to companies or municipalities. Additionally, we plan to sell this system as a module to government entities for customised measurements. Our go-to-market strategy includes leveraging airdrop marketing and forming partnerships with city halls and universities to drive adoption.

## SolUX

### Description
A UI and UX design library for Solana - crypto based applications

### Details

- **Country:** Nigeria
- **Additional Info:** Everyone keeps talking about Dev this, Dev that, the visionaries , the founders.

No one talks about the designers, the product teams, the people that care about the UX.
And with this comes missed opportunity for innovation in Blockchain UX and UI. 

With consistent UX patterns, intuitive and delightful UI comes great and massive Solana - crypto adoption
During this Hackathon season, we spoke to a lot of builders and one of their major challenges was finding UI design inspiration and knowing which UX flow to follow and there was nothing to guide the designers.

We hope by the next Hackathon, we would have made building in web3 easier for designers.  Because bridging this gap allows for crypto innovation in terms of UI and UX

## CodinLab

### Description
CodinLab is an educational platform, initially running on Web 2, now integrated into the Solana ecosystem. Users can experience Solana technologies through live coding tasks and gain access to new training by earning NFT rewards. The platform supports interactive learning processes and offers exclusive training and mentoring opportunities for premium NFT holders.

### Details

- **Country:** Turkey
- **Additional Info:** We developed our project together with 4 teammates. 3 of our teammates are cybersecurity experts and only 1 of them has worked in the blockchain field before. Our goal is to provide a starting platform for both beginners and software developers who are new to Solana and blockchain. At Solana, it is not enough to just read documents and attend trainings. For example, our backend is written in Go and we realized that it was difficult to find enough documentation on this topic.

CodinLab is a training platform designed to fill these gaps. Users can experience real-world blockchain technologies through live coding tasks while practicing in the Solana ecosystem. At the same time, they can access new tutorials and improve their blockchain skills with the NFTs they earn within the platform.

## Solynx

### Description
What is a Decentralized Vercel or Web3 Firebase?
A decentralized version of Vercel or Firebase is a platform that offers similar features for deploying web applications but leverages blockchain and decentralized storage instead of traditional cloud servers.
In a decentralized Vercel, developers can upload, build, and deploy their static websites (or front-end apps) to decentralized storage networks like Arweave or IPFS. The deployment process mirrors how traditional cloud services like Vercel work, but instead of relying on centralized servers, it uses decentralized infrastructure. Similarly, a Web3 Firebase would offer features like real-time databases, authentication, and hosting but would utilize decentralized technologies, ensuring that data and hosting are spread across multiple nodes in a trustless, immutable manner.
The key features of these platforms include:
Decentralized hosting (Arweave, IPFS)
Decentralized domain resolution (ENS, SNS, or Unstoppable Domains)
Decentralized backend (blockchain smart contracts to manage logic, databases, and interactions)
Why is Blockchain Needed in a Decentralized Vercel?
Blockchain is needed in a decentralized Vercel for several reasons:
Immutable Storage: Blockchain ensures that deployments are tamper-proof, preventing unauthorized changes to code once it’s deployed. Every update is stored in a verifiable and auditable way.
Transparent Deployment History: Blockchain provides a transparent ledger of all deployments. Each version of your site can be traced, and you can roll back to any previous state using transaction history.
Decentralized Access Control: With blockchain, you can manage domain ownership and access control without relying on a central authority. For instance, ownership of an ENS domain can be verified on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring no single entity controls access to the domain.
Trustless Payments: Blockchain allows for decentralized payment mechanisms using smart contracts. Users can be charged for deployment services in cryptocurrency, allowing global, borderless payments with lower fees than traditional payment gateways.
Benefits of Blockchain in a Decentralized Vercel
Censorship Resistance: Because the content is hosted on decentralized networks (Arweave/IPFS) and the logic is managed by smart contracts on a blockchain, it’s nearly impossible for a central authority or government to take down or censor the website.
Security and Integrity: Blockchain ensures that once the website is deployed, it cannot be tampered with or modified by unauthorized parties. The deployment history is publicly available, and smart contracts can guarantee the integrity of the build process.
Ownership and Control: In a traditional cloud service, the platform provider has significant control over the hosting and deployment of applications. In a decentralized Vercel, developers fully own and control their deployments and domains via smart contracts, avoiding reliance on centralized authorities.
Global Accessibility: Blockchain ensures that anyone with internet access can verify the deployment and access the application, removing the need for central intermediaries, load balancers, or cloud providers that could have regional restrictions.
Cost Efficiency: With decentralized storage like Arweave, once data is uploaded, it is stored permanently, avoiding the recurring costs that come with centralized cloud providers. Blockchain-based payments also eliminate intermediaries, reducing fees.
By leveraging blockchain, decentralized Vercel provides a more secure, immutable, and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional cloud deployment platforms.

## GreenVault

### Description
The transition to renewable energy is often slowed by financial barriers and a lack of incentives for individuals and businesses to make the switch from fossil fuels. To address this, we propose a blockchain-based platform that rewards users with tokens for adopting or producing renewable energy. These tokens can be earned by actions like installing solar panels, driving electric vehicles, or reducing energy consumption. They can then be traded or redeemed for goods and services, creating a tangible incentive to reduce carbon footprints. All activities are verified and tracked on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.

For example, a decentralized platform could reward users for cutting their energy use or investing in green technologies. These tokens could be exchanged for discounts on energy-efficient appliances or staked in renewable energy projects to earn a share of profits. By integrating DeFi, the platform would enable token trading, staking, and participation in liquidity pools tied to green energy initiatives. Users could grow their tokens or earn interest while supporting the global shift towards sustainable energy.

## Bando

### Description
In our MVP we built a direct connection between the traditional Mexican fiat infrastructure and Solana. Users can do a traditional wire transfer and get any of the 18 assets on Solana that we have available (JITO, ORCA, SOL, USDC, USDT, WEN, and more). 

Our long term game is being the payments infrastructure to enable spending features for on-chain users. Users can spend their assets directly from their wallets and pay for their bills, tup-up their cellphones, buy things on Amazon or other merchants, or off-ramp their assets. We bundle fiat payment APIs with a wide product catalog to and offer a simple widget that wallets and dApps can implement with an integration as simple as installing an NPM package. 

Once implemented, the user sees in their favorite wallet or dApp a new button saying “Spend”. When they click it, the widget appears and lets the user buy any gift card in their geography.

### Details

- **Country:** Mexico
- **Additional Info:** Here you can see our deck. 
https://docsend.com/view/9fjevmxxn6w3einv

We identified that payments is the best way to off-ramp. We've processed more than $250,000 USD in volume and more than 70% of the transactions are off-ramps. Talking to users they told us they want to spend their assets and the best way to do that is directly through the crypto wallets they use every day.

## ScootScoot

### Description
Scoot-Scoot is an innovative e-scooter rental platform that leverages blockchain technology to reimagine urban transportation. Built on the Solana blockchain, Scoot-Scoot offers transparent, secure, and efficient operations.Users earn cryptocurrency rewards for choosing this green transportation option. Each ride contributes to reducing carbon emissions, with data recorded on the blockchain.

### Details

- **Country:** Sierra Leone
- **Additional Info:** Scoot Scoot
Key Team Members

Mitchel Dennis: Former community manager at Christex Foundation, now in a DevRel role. Built the core Solana API and mobile app.
Eugene John: Design lead at Christex Foundation, responsible for all aspects of Scoot Scoot's design.
Ayorinde John: University student and multimedia producer at Christex Foundation, led the frontend mobile application development.

Why Scoot Scoot Stands Out
Scoot Scoot is revolutionizing urban mobility with a blockchain-powered e-scooter rental platform built on Solana. Key differentiators include:

Carbon Token Rewards: On-chain ride recording creates a tamperproof reward system, incentivizing eco-friendly choices.
Community-Driven Approach (SkootDAO): Fostering a community of "Earth's guardians" through events like Skoothathons, ScootUPs, and Scootcursions.
Gamification: Merging real-world mobility with gaming through Scoot Game, where in-game tokens can be used for rides.
DePIN Integrations: Potential collaborations with Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network projects on Solana.
Environmental Focus: Directly addressing the urban mobility crisis and its environmental impact.

Addressing Urban Mobility and Environmental Challenges

Tackling high carbon emissions from transportation (21% of global CO2 emissions)
Combating air pollution in cities (causing 4.2 million deaths annually)
Reducing traffic congestion and gridlock
Providing effective incentives for eco-friendly transportation choices
Offering a more impactful solution than current web2 e-vehicle options

Carbon Token System

Users earn tokens for every ride taken
Additional tokens can be earned through the Scoot Game
Partnerships are being established to create real-world utility for the tokens

Key Partnerships

Working partnership with Smoove, a Sierra Leonean zero-emission electronic vehicle provider
Agreements with teams at Christex Foundation to expand Carbon Token utility

## PagCrypto

### Description
Today, the cryptocurrency market is in constant expansion, and the Solana blockchain stands out for its speed, scalability, and efficiency. However, one of the major barriers to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies around the world is the lack of integration with the traditional financial system. This is precisely where our solution comes into play.

We present pagcrypto.finance, an innovative payment gateway that connects the Solana ecosystem to the local financial system of each country, enabling the automatic payment of national payment orders directly with Solana assets.

Our product allows anyone or any business using Solana to carry out everyday transactions, such as paying bills, sending money to family members, or even processing payments in their businesses, all with the same ease they are already familiar with, while leveraging the advantages that blockchain offers.

We are building a bridge between the world of cryptocurrencies and the local financial system, focusing on providing a fast, secure, and accessible payment experience for everyone. By integrating Solana with widely used payment methods in each country, we are opening the door to a new era of digital payments.

Our goal is to simplify the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life, making them as common as any other payment method. And by doing so, we are contributing to the mass adoption of blockchain, bringing more freedom and efficiency to users.

Join us on this journey of financial innovation. With PapCripto, we are shaping the future of digital payments worldwide. Solana meets the traditional financial system in a groundbreaking, practical, and secure way.

Go to the top and great profits!

## zKonnect

### Description
zKonnect is a platform that Empowers creators with Verified, Token-Gated Events. We are here with an economic solution for the problems of managing multiple software and unethical ticket bypassing that creators face while managing an online event.
 
zKonnect makes creator onboarding, ticket creation and event hosting seamless. The creator just verifies there follower count thorugh zk proofs and they leverage event creation after getting verified. Once an event is created the creator gets a unique Blink which they can share in their socials ensuring mass distribution.
Fans can buy tickets from the post and get their ticket as cNFT. We are minting cNFTs on demand which are SolBound so that there is no unauthorized transfer of the ticket.
The ticket (cNFT) in the fan's wallet has each and every detail of the event, once the ticket holder clicks on the meet link he will be redirected to the event meet. We are hosting the event through token gating stopping unethical entry. zKonnect uses dRTC to host the meeting in our platform itself with the help of Huddle01 SDK ensuring a smooth and seamless event experience for both the host and attendees perspective.

Here's an overview : 

Creator POV:-

Connect wallet -> verifies themselves -> access dashboard -> create event -> Give details -> get Blinks and meet link -> post in on X ->Follows the meet link-> joins event as host.

 Fan POV : 

Buys ticket from X -> get a ticket as NFT -> All details on the NFT -> Follows the meet link -> passes token gating -> enjoys event.

### Details

- **Country:** India
- **Additional Info:** While testing the project as a creator, here are a few suggestions for a smooth experience:

1> Please airdrop your devnet wallet with devnet USDC from Circle faucet. This will act as a Fan to buy the ticket. Link to airdrop: https://faucet.circle.com/
2> Don't use any low-end device while verifying yourself with Reclaim protocol.
3> The contract repo is private. Access is given to colosseum github.
4> Please do reach out if you are having trouble while testing the product.

## Windfall

### Description
Windfall is the first gaming-based Liquid Staking Token (LST) project.

The core concept is to gamify DeFi, allowing users to benefit from it while having fun, often without even realizing they are engaging with it.

The problem we address is that DeFi can feel dangerous and risky, which often discourages retail users from participating.

Our solution is a gaming-based LST, where users can enjoy themselves while earning rewards with minimized risk, all without being fully aware that they are interacting with DeFi.

So far, Windfall has gained strong traction, with a waitlist of over 20,000 users.

The project’s vision is to solve the web3 onboarding challenge by using gaming and gamification to make the experience more accessible and enjoyable for everyday users.

## PRISM Explorer

### Description
PRISM is a Solana data intelligence platform. It provides users with customizable data enrichment and analysis tools such as machine learning algorithms, intelligent blockchain queries, and AI agents that allow them to build and explore Solana with confidence.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** PRISM Explorer, codenamed Littrow UI, is a frontend interface built for interacting with Solana data stored inside of clickhouse. It was started as a hackathon project, but quickly also became the primary way that Trustless Engineering allows its users to visualize and interact with Solana data in a more developer friendly way - via SQL - than other tooling that exists today. 

Not a SQL expert? Ask our PRISM AI agent to build queries for you. We currently offer tables from our custom data ingestion pipeline, which includes blocks, transactions, and instructions, as well as third party tables from Vybe Network, Birdeye, and more.

What is being submitted is a work in progress, but it is LIVE! Anyone wishing to access the live app can send us their wallet and we will add you to an allow list. The production deployment can be found at https://app.prism.sh

Our plan is to abstract the specific parts that interact with our infrastructure and allow anyone to download extracts of data from our services, any RPC provider, or their own custom datasets.

Littrow UI puts SQL back on the menu for Solana developers everywhere.

## AgentOS

### Description
AgentOS is an AI Agent Crowdsourcing Network that will forever change how labor market works in our society. It will replace traditional freelance labor marketplace,  crowdsourcing platform and even corporations.  
AgentOS is a network of agents on user ends. Once there is a task, the task will be broadcasted to all nodes in the network. Nodes who accepts the task will automatically collaborate and complete the job with AI power.

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** We envision a future where AI agents collaborate to accomplish tasks under human supervision. This paradigm shift offers several advantages:

1. Unlimited communication bandwidth between agents, surpassing the limitations of human-to-human or human-to-agent interactions.
2. The development of powerful edge device AI models capable of handling 90% of routine work. Utilizing these resources prevents wastage of computational power.
3. Significant improvements in efficiency and quality across various industries. This shift will encourage humans to focus on areas where they excel, particularly in creativity and innovation.

The next step in this evolution is implementing smart contracts to facilitate automatic payments between AI agents. For instance, a central agent could compensate an end node agent upon task completion using cryptocurrency transactions, all governed by smart contracts.

## Cacao Gold 

### Description
Cacao EcoFarming On Solana As A Socio-Climate Impact Enterprise 

With DePIN technology, Cacao Gold converts cacao ecofarming as an RWA on an 800-hectare land allocated by the Philippine government in a public-private partnership to combat the global cacao supply crisis and mitigate climate change.

### Details

- **Country:** Japan
- **Additional Info:** "There could be no more chocolate by 2040"
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/chocolate-is-on-track-to-go-extinct-in-40-years

Cacao, the main ingredient for chocolate production, is facing a global extinction event if current climate change trends are not addressed. In fact, Criollo, the rarest and most expensive cacao variety that grows in my hometown of Leyte, has currently been reduced to less than 0.01% production capacity worldwide due to environmental changes. 

Cacao Gold project is a blueprint for how blockchain technology can transform industries with significant socio-climate impacts. By merging decentralized infrastructure, real-world asset tokenization, and sustainable agriculture, this project has the potential to create a scalable, transparent model for ecological and social empowerment.

By utilizing a public-private partnership vehicle to convert a 800-hectare land into a cacao ecofarm, we can set the precedent for a successful Web 3.0 pilot case study for replicate models that can be adapted by other forest, crop and environmental ecosystem projects on the blockchain. 

We believe we can save the cacao tree in collaboration with Solana and create a pioneering movement to regenerate the future of the chocolate industry.

## Plantee

### Description
Plantee is a movement dedicated to fighting climate change by promoting plant-based diets. Through the Plantee app, users are incentivized to consume plant-based meals, generating verified CO2 offset equivalents that are sold on a marketplace. Plantee's mission extends beyond just the app and marketplace; it aims to empower individuals to take meaningful climate action into their own hands through everyday food choices.

### Details

- **Country:** Singapore
- **Additional Info:** Two months ago, we launched our basic MVP on the Base blockchain. The app initially focused on an "Eat to Earn" concept, rewarding users for their plant-based meal choices.

Based on user feedback and our learnings, we've made significant improvements:

1. Refocused on Climate Impact
  - Users expressed a strong interest in understanding their environmental impact.
  - We've redesigned the app to highlight quantifiable climate effects, using CO₂ per kg as our primary metric.
  - Introduced an Offset+ marketplace, allowing users to sell their earned offsets.
  - This marketplace creates a feedback loop: offset buyers fund rewards for app users, incentivizing more plant-based choices.

2. Migration to Solana Blockchain

We've transitioned from Base to the Solana blockchain for several reasons:

- Solana's consumer-first approach aligns with our vision.
- Enhanced potential for collaborations and integrations with other DePIN projects.
- Solana's extremely low transaction fees are ideal for the micropayments central to our reward system.
- Our decision to migrate was solidified after attending Breakpoint 2024, where we witnessed the progress and potential of other projects on Solana. This experience has left us incredibly excited to work within the Solana ecosystem. This is also where we learnt of the Radar Hackathon

These changes represent a significant evolution of our project during this hackathon.

## Borderless

### Description
Makes ICO GREAT again!

Imagine if companies around the world could hold a funding offer via their website just like an ICO did.

Hi, we are Borderless.company.

We are building tokenized company infrastructure.

[What]
The tokenized company is a hybrid coordination model of a legal entity and an on-chain entity.

A typical company that has a share like stock and membership could use this scheme to bring their shares onto the blockchain and unlock the opportunity to onboard millions of potential shareholders.

The tokenized company has the potential to revolutionize the traditional company operating model, but at the same time, it requires a very complex knowledge base.

[Problem]
Here are three main barriers that make share tokenization difficult.

1. Require in-depth knowledge of the law.
2. Require highly technical knowledge of blockchain and tokens.
3. UI/UX development for easy user onboarding.

[Solution]
How Borderless will solve these barriers and fill the gap between real-world companies and blockchain.

We'll provide three magical solutions here.

1.LETS (Legal Embedded Token Standard)
2.SCT (Smart Company Templates)
3.Borderless Apps

1. LETS (Legal Embedded Token Standard)

when the company trying to tokenize its shares LETS will serve the seamless tokenization experience while meeting the legal requirements of each country.

Now we cover two jurisdictions and two legal entity models.

DAO LLC JPN Token standard.
Swiss AG Token standard.

2. SCT (Smart Company Template)

Once the company decides to tokenize their shares, they have to optimize the operation agreement like articles of incorporation and other legal docs that define the company's operation rule. SCT provides a set of legal doc templates for each company model.

3. Borderless Apps

A variety of applications is provided for each jurisdiction to maximize the potential of LETS and SCT.

Here are some example apps that we are under development as a pre-set.

Estuary App → Tokenized share offering widget embeddable in the customer's channel. Demo (Japanese)

Launch App → No-code legalized on-chain entity set up.

Mint App → Issue the tokenized share with LETS.

Treasury App → Quick set up the digital bank account and wallet.

Governance App → Submit a proposal and manage role assignment.

[Go to market]
Now we are focusing on DAOLLC in Japan.

Since April, 22nd this year DAOLLC incorporation has been officially admitted by the Japanese government.

We've been involved in the process of the Japanese DAO law legislation as a team and also helped launch the Japan DAO Association, a self-regulatory organization.

We will incorporate the knowledge we have gained there into our products and provide them to users in Japan first.

[Traction]
The onboarding of the first customer(PR written in Japanese ) is almost complete and the pilot token sale is planned for the end of August.

We have received inquiries from many other customers and will accompany them to become a solid success story from a global perspective.

[Future Plan]
LETS and SCT can be applied to various legal entities in various countries. Working extensively with the Ethereum community and other synergistic projects, we will work on blockchain mass adoption worldwide through a tokenized company!

Tokenized companies will eat the world!

## Fusogen

### Description
Fusogen is a platform facilitating M&A and value integrations for DAOs. As decentralized communities and blockchain-based entities grow, there is a growing need for market consolidation and for DAOs to consolidate resources, collaborate, and merge effectively. However, DAOs operate under different rules, relying on smart contracts and decentralized governance, so traditional M&A processes don’t directly apply. Fusogen addresses this gap by providing a framework to streamline the secure merging of DAOs, allowing them to combine assets, governance structures, and treasuries in a secure and automated manner, locally or cross-chain.

## Payable

### Description
Payable is a blockchain-based payment solution designed to simplify and enhance the process of on-chain payments. It addresses key challenges in decentralized finance by providing a trustless payroll system, enabling automated recurrent payments, and offering flexible payment options on the Solana network. By leveraging smart contracts, Payable ensures that freelancers and businesses can conduct transactions securely, transparently, and without intermediaries.

With these capabilities, Payable aims to redefine the way freelancers, businesses, and service providers manage payments, making it a powerful solution for anyone looking for a more reliable and flexible financial tool on Solana.

### Details

- **Country:** Nigeria
- **Additional Info:** Why We’re Building Payable

1. Empowering Freelancers with Trustless Payments
The gig economy is growing rapidly, but payment issues remain a significant pain point for freelancers. Delayed payments, disputed invoices, and lack of clarity around earnings are common problems. Payable solves these by introducing a trustless payroll system, where smart contracts guarantee that payments are released only when agreed conditions are met. This ensures transparency and reliability, fostering better relationships between freelancers and clients.

2. Bridging the Gap in Recurrent Payments on Solana
While Solana is known for its speed and efficiency, there’s no out-of-the-box support for recurrent payments. This makes it difficult to automate subscriptions, salaries, or recurring service payments on the network. Payable addresses this gap by introducing a solution that natively supports automated recurring transactions, reducing manual intervention and errors.

3. Enabling Flexibility with Specified Payment Tokens
One of the biggest challenges in crypto payments is the rigidity of payment methods. Traditional systems rarely allow for flexibility in choosing payment tokens. Payable allows both payers and payees to specify which tokens they want to use, provided there’s sufficient liquidity. This adaptability empowers users to transact in their preferred assets, making payments more fluid and aligned with user preferences.

4. Enhancing Trust and Security with On-Chain Verification
Traditional payment platforms often operate with a lack of transparency, making it hard to verify the status of payments. Payable leverages blockchain’s innate transparency, where every transaction can be traced and verified on-chain. This enhances trust and security, providing users with confidence that their payments are handled reliably and securely.

Overall, Payable is built to be a robust, flexible, and trust-enhancing solution for individuals and businesses navigating the evolving landscape of on-chain payments.

## Graph Of Humanity

### Description
In one sentence -

Graph of Humanity is the only place on the Internet with real humans, where every real human is enrolled in a UBI program to get paid $ 1000 a month, and all this is secured by our very own  decentralized justice protocol. 

Simple comparison - 

Imagine Worlcoin on Solana, but one that actually delivers on the promise of UBI in the form of 1000 USDC to each person. 

Imagine Twitter & Facebook, except one that's hyper financial, 100% open source, has no bots & built from first principles to serve creators, not algorithms.

Imagine a digital version of the Supreme Court, except it's 100x faster, cheaper and decentralized. 

That's Graph of Humanity. 

In 5 sentences -

- Graph of Humanity is a maximally sybil-resistant graph of real human beings, which is a necessity in an age where it’s impossible to distinguish between humans and AI.

- We’ve built a decentralized, credibly neutral dispute resolution protocol called the “Decentropy Schellix Protocol”, which we use to verify the personhood of each account, where everyone can participate and earn from making correct judgements, and this on-chain dispute resolution justice system can be used for all cases that require human judgement, i.e, they can’t be settled with smart contracts.

- Vertically integrating the decentralized justice system with a graph of real human beings allows us to build powerful experiences and use cases (starting with a hyperfinancial social / creator platform) that uniquely leverage this to create lasting value within the graph.

- All value created within the graph is added to a programmatic treasury that no one controls, which distributes 90% of the eligible funds to every human who create this value every month, in the form of stablecoin USDC payments of 1000 USDC to each real human.

- 10% of the funds goes to the team to incentivise development and maintenance of the graph, leading to the first non-governmental, for-profit sustainable UBI distribution scheme.

### Details

Testing Instructions -> 
Go to GraphOfHumanity.com and sign up! (Please check your spam folder if you don't immediately find the verification email). 
Once you've signed up, connect your wallet and make sure your wallet is on devnet. Airdrop yourself some sol and then some USDC from the airdrop box on the left side of the feed. 

Then, I highly recommend applying for a citizenship (otherwise your posts won't have your picture). 
In the citizenship sign up window, choose "jessegoldberg" as the account that will vouch for you. Enter your correct name and a correct picture to help me identify you. You can enter any other details about you (which doesn't have to correct as we're on devnet), and any video (make sure the file size is less than 50mb). After you've application is successful, go to your profile and set an appropriate username and bio. Then, please reach out to me on email - enigmaticabhisek@gmail.com or telegram @satoshi69420 and I'll vouch for your account after which you'll be able to see randomly selected judges vote to either accept or reject your application. 

For now, I've kept all other functionalities of the site open, regardless of whether you're a citizen or not, so you can test all the creator social features like messenger tips, paywalls, post tips, supporter-only posts, etc. after you've applied to be a citizen. 

If I've vouched for you, you can go to your profile and click on the Pending Verification button to see your randomly chosen judges, and watch them verify you, as well click on a button to verify that this process was in fact, on-chain and verifiably random. 

I plan to open-source everything about Graph of Humanity soon, but if you're checking out the code, the contracts folder contains all the contracts. If you want to run GoH locally, the frontend/front folder is where you should npm run dev. Cranking scripts are located in the cranking folder. While open sourcing, I'll release a version of the cranking scripts that anyone will be able to run for both the UBI & judge selection. This isn't possible right now, as I'm on free plans on most of what I'm using to save costs.

Graph of Humanity is in active development right now. I've only been building this for a month and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I may upgrade the contracts -- and/or change significant portions of the app during the duration of this month, so things may not work as expected - notably, the voucher username might be different for you and the judgment process may be brought down to 20 minutes instead of 24 hours to help me iterate faster. If this is the case, you'll clearly see a "warning" label on the citizenship application window and you should reach out to me to get the username of a relevant voucher before you apply. 

Thank you, and please reach out to me with any questions or feedback!

## StarBlink & XtensionX

### Description
StarBlink is an X/Twitter social mini-game based on Solana Blink.

XtensionX is an X/Twitter social mini-app infrastructure that can enhance Solana Blink.

### Details

- **Country:** Hong Kong
- **Additional Info:** XtensionX can natively implement Web3 mini-programs on Twitter, supporting all types of Web3 applications: Games, Memecoins, DeFi, and more. Existing applications can onboard without modification, and developing new ones is also very simple, requiring just a few lines of code. Additionally, it is decentralized and non-custodial, fully compatible with both Twitter and existing Web3 wallets. XtensionX supports binding Twitter social operations within mini-programs, providing native support for better leveraging Twitter for viral distribution.

  XtensionX demo: https://youtu.be/FdQTj78gtug

  After developing XtensionX, we planned to create the first Twitter mini-game based on XtensionX. However, when Solana Actions/Blinks was announced in late June, we were surprised because we had also planned to release XtensionX in late June. Although XtensionX is a more powerful and potentially greater framework for Twitter mini-programs, Solana Actions/Blinks clearly has a better user base. Therefore, we decided to first develop a mini-game based on Solana Actions/Blinks, leading to the creation of StarBlink.

Star Blink is a Twitter/X social minigame based on Solana Blink, where you can earn the memecoin $star by playing the game. Each player can get a free miner, and by attaching the miner link in any tweet, they can start mining. When other users who have set up Solana Actions/Blinks visit the tweet containing the miner link, the link will render as a Blink mini-program, increasing the miner’s view count and thus boosting the $starlicon output. You can collect $starlicon once every 24 hours, with 50% of the mined amount being protected and the remaining 50% vulnerable to being "stolen" by other players. Players can upgrade their own miner or upgrade others' miner to become shareholders and receive dividends and additional benefits.

## Marshmallow

### Description
Marshmallow is teaching kids financial literacy on Solana through hands-on, on-chain tools. Inspired by the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment (where children who delayed gratification for a larger reward demonstrated better long-term life outcomes) it focuses on key principles like saving, earning, and goal-setting. Kids learn money management by completing jobs, setting financial goals, and receiving savings rewards set by parents. Marshmallow re-imagines the piggy bank as a family DAO, is the only app using yield incentives and has no KYC barriers, making it globally accessible. Let's educate the next generation of exit liquidity! :)

## Ravdesk

### Description
Ravdesk is a voting and resource allocation protocol built on blockchain technology. Ravdesk is a protocol we’ve built to redefine how freelancers and businesses collaborate. By leveraging blockchain technology, we’ve created a platform that addresses common issues like trust, payment disputes, and transparency. Our blockchain-based escrow system securely holds funds until agreed-upon milestones are completed, ensuring that both parties are protected.

With our milestone-based fund release, freelancers submit proof of work, and once the business verifies it, the smart contract automatically releases payment. This eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and speeding up the collaboration process.

At Ravdesk, we prioritize transparency and trust. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a clear, auditable history. We also offer a reputation system, dispute resolution tools, and a streamlined process to help freelancers and businesses work together more efficiently.

Freelancers on Ravdesk experience faster payments and reduced admin work, while businesses get access to a wider talent pool and more efficient project management. And we’re not stopping here—our roadmap includes plans to expand functionality, enhance security, and integrate with more platforms.

## StakeShield

### Description
Validator insurance market, where validators can insure himself from temporary stake losses and be sure, that during time of waiting returning the stake, they will receive compensation that will be enough for their expenses

### Details

- **Country:** Ukraine
- **Additional Info:** Our project proposes a revolutionary solution: Validator insurance market. This platform allows validators to insure themselves against temporary stake losses. By paying a premium into an insurance pool, validators can receive compensation during periods when their delegated stake drops unexpectedly. The insurance mechanism is powered by smart contracts that automatically assess and validate claims based on transparent criteria, ensuring swift payouts that cover essential expenses.

This innovation not only provides a safety net for validators but also enhances the overall stability and resilience of blockchain networks. By mitigating financial risks associated with stake volatility, validators can focus on maintaining network performance without the constant fear of unexpected losses. Stakeholders also benefit, as a stable validator community contributes to network reliability and trustworthiness.

Join us in pioneering a solution that addresses a critical gap in the blockchain infrastructure. The Validator Insurance Market is more than just a safety mechanism; it's a step toward a more secure, efficient, and decentralized future for all participants in the blockchain space.

Link to our Pitchdeck: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VpTkRBQ1F-aACzT_alhsHo0JkqIFIiHy/view 

Problem: Each year, the integrity of the job market is compromised by millions of fake degrees and certificates, with 70% of CVs hiding at least one falsified credential, making the current verification process slow, costly, and unreliable. This billion-dollar problem of Fake degrees and certificates racket is becoming commonplace globally, hence there is an urgent need for efficient, standardized, and cost-effective verification solution. 10 Million Fake Degrees, Sold Globally: Fake Diploma Mills earn $2 billion per year. 25+ Fake Certificates Rackets Busted in 2023, across India, US, UAE.

Solution: Our solution, to e-Seal credentials and e-Verify them directly on the blockchain, transforms the verification process from a slow, costly, and fraud-prone manual system to an instant, secure, and cost-effective method, ensuring the authenticity of academic and professional credentials. We will record the data about the certificate and its digital file on the blockchain via eSealer and anyone can verify the certificate’s authenticity by uploading the digital file through the Verifier tab. If a certificate has been tampered with, the mismatch with the immutable on-chain record will reveal the fraud immediately.

Traction: Since launching, Edubuk is rapidly gaining traction with over 50,000 certificates e-Sealed on the blockchain, and 15 MoUs signed with 12 universities and 3 background verification companies. Our partnerships with major regulators in India (NSDC: National Skills Development Corporation, ONEST: Open Network of Education, Skills and Transformation) and in the US (with IEE under NACES: National Association of Credentials Evaluation Services)  and third-party background verification companies in India and the US underscore the growing trust and adoption of our blockchain-based verification solution. 

Future Roadmap: Building on our current success, Edubuk's roadmap includes launching verifiable CVs on the blockchain, enabling secure and transparent career profiles. By late 2025, we'll integrate AI-driven job matching and a Generative AI Co-Pilot, revolutionizing the way HRs and candidates connect for employment opportunities.

With a potential Serviceable Obtainable Market of 2 billion individuals in formalized education and employment, Edubuk is poised to capture a significant share, translating into a $125 billion opportunity as we expand globally.

Business Model: For our Go-To-Market strategy, we are leveraging strong B2B partnerships across universities, employers, regulators, and third-party verification companies to drive adoption. Our business model generates revenue through subscription revenues: 1.) from blockchain-based certificates recorded by universities for their students and employers for their employees and 2.) an AI-powered job matching platform for employers.

Team: Edubuk's leadership team combines over 45 years of expertise and industry experience in finance, education, and cutting-edge technology domain, bringing together the complementary skills needed to execute and drive our vision forward. Edubuk's Advisory Board is comprised of industry veterans with decades of experience in global startups, academia, and digital transformation, providing unparalleled guidance to drive our strategic growth.

Edubuk's global recognition and numerous awards from prestigious institutions, including Harvard, MIT, G20, and organizations underscore our impact and innovation in the edtech and blockchain space. Given our internal projections of potential number of transactions given our partnership with Universities and Employers, we project Edubuk’s holistic platform to generate 2 million transactions per day to more than 4 million in next 4-5 years time-frame.

## The Grid

### Description
Powering Discoverability for Web3

As people come into the Solana ecosystem for the first time, they need to understand what applications they can use. To do this they may enter via a variety of wallets or other websites that list projects. 

Very often this information is incorrect, badly formatted, or out of date. To get the data right, some teams are investing in researchers or building tech infrastructure, which has a high cost with marginal return as the feature is not often directly money making, but is additive. Hence many of these orgs want to get the data from somewhere where it is their core business. 

Introducing The Grid, where our one and only focus is on providing neutral, highly accurate and structured Metadata about Solana projects. This means that data platforms can integrate a dataset directly and not worry about it again. 

We went live with our API on 8 April at the end of the last hackathon, and now we have early users and many projects that want to claim their profiles.

## ByteLuv

### Description
ByteLuv is a revolutionary platform that leverages game theory to make finding love both fun and secure. Our mission is to recreate the spontaneity and authenticity of real-life connections in the online dating world. Here, everyone can express love uniquely, every identity is verified, and chance encounters happen just like in life.

How We Achieve This:

1. Staking Instead of Liking:
Show Commitment and Compatibility: Users stake tokens to express interest in someone. A match occurs only if the other person stakes the same amount of tokens in return. With a daily limit of 100 tokens, this system emphasizes meaningful connections over casual swiping.

2. Robust Verification by Verifiers:
Ensure Authentic Identities: ByteLuv employs a Proof of Stake system for user verification, supported by Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) to prevent exploitation. This makes it exceptionally difficult for fake profiles or bad actors to infiltrate the platform.

3. Location-Based Random Matching:
Emulate Real-Life Encounters: Users are matched based on specific locations like cafes, libraries, or parks. You'll meet others in your vicinity in a random order, simulating the unpredictability and excitement of real-world interactions.
Join ByteLuv today and experience online dating that feels as genuine and spontaneous as real life.

## Solana Safe Transfer

### Description
Solana-Safe-Transfer is a smart contract program designed to enhance the security of transferring tokens and assets across the Solana blockchain. While Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions are ideal for many use cases, they can pose risks when transferring large amounts, as accidental input errors (like mistyping a wallet address) can result in irreversible loss of funds. Solana-Safe-Transfer addresses this issue by requiring a confirmation code along with the recipient's wallet address, adding an extra layer of verification to ensure that tokens are sent to the intended recipient. This makes the transfer process more secure and user-friendly, especially for high-value transactions.

## Verxio Protocol

### Description
Verxio is an ads creator for web3 developers and brands

Projects share a common pain point; the difficulty connecting with the right users who would benefit from their product offerings.

Users on the other hand are bombarded with countless projects daily, making it nearly impossible to discover product offerings that truly align with their interests and needs.

Verxio makes ad creation easy, dynamic, interactive, and rewarding for users. Every campaign is a blink.

The most important part of any marketing campaign is the call-to-action. Verxio renders this as a blink, enabling users to interact directly with the project's offering from their environment.

Verxio increases the retention rate by 57% and creates a viral network effect for the project.

Projects can quickly integrate our SDK/API infrastructure into their existing application or use our no-code interface to experience verxio on the go.

During our private testing, over 126 blinks were created from campaigns by both web3 and web2 developers and brands with industries ranging from e-commerce to real estate, education, etc.

Verxio is not just changing how projects advertise but it is also reshaping how they grow, connect, and engage their community.

## Zeak Navigator 

### Description
Zeak Navigator: Making Compressed Token Management Easy and Accessible on Solana

Want to maximize your crypto assets effortlessly? zeak Navigator unlocks the promise of compressed tokens, helping you save costs and get the most out of your Solana journey. It is a user-focused tool that manages your compressed tokens on Solana, simplifying compressing, decompressing, and discovering dApps based on wallet contents, while providing an intuitive experience for both developers and non-developers. zeak Navigator is the simplest way to manage, compress, and explore zkCompression on Solana. By leveraging zkCompression technology, zeak Navigator offers a streamlined, secure, and efficient way to interact with the Solana ecosystem.


Zeak Navigator Simplifies Compressed Token Management for All Users

Intuitive UI: Zeak Navigator provides an intuitive user interface, simplifying compressed token management for both developers and non-developers. This user-friendly approach makes blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience.

Personalized dApp Recommendations: The platform offers personalized decentralized application (dApp) recommendations based on a user's wallet content. For instance, if a user holds SOL, Zeak Navigator might suggest Jupiter Swap for token swapping or Sanctum for buying hSOL. This feature saves users time and effort by providing relevant suggestions based on their holdings.

Fast Compression and Decompression: Zeak Navigator features fast, one-click compression and decompression for tokens, streamlining the process and reducing complexity. Users can manage their tokens with ease, thanks to this simplified experience.

## Twizzin

### Description

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** demo url: https://twizzin-git-demo-timknapp12s-projects.vercel.app?_vercel_share=FavFeQwcGLp2eYqVj8Oy9xu3hRNS4qNN
demo instructions: as per the demo in the loom video - connect to our X and TG on the first page. To create a game, click the "create game" button at the top right. You must connect to a wallet on devnet but don't need any funds. The demo does not actually run a transaction yet.
more detailed slide deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fu9iprdbYSv58PldUaJNDsWcXdELgebAiv4nPmF9pMI/edit?usp=sharing

We are in the early stages. Our first step was building and deploying an MVP of the Solana program to devnet. Based on feedback we received from Break Point and islandDao, we have since pivoted, which will require a refactor. The refactor will allow more players to join games and also allow SPL (not just native SOL) as valid currencies.
We truly believe Twizzin will add value to the entire Solana ecosystem. We have both been devs for a long time but this is our first time building a Solana application. This is our first hackathon and we are super excited to show the community what we can do. Regardless of the hackathon outcome, Twizzin will be shipped.

## SOULID

### Description
Soul.ID, a decentralized identity solution leveraging blockchain technology to verify real users through fingerprint with ZK-Proof.

### Details

- **Country:** Malaysia
- **Additional Info:** SoulID is designed to enhance the Solana ecosystem by verifying real users without revealing their actual identities. This helps address scamming issues in the Solana ecosystem, especially during meme coin launches. Each individual can only have one unique ID in SoulID (thanks to fingerprint verification), and each SoulID can only be linked to one wallet. 

If someone scams others using their linked wallet, their reputation in SoulID will be negatively impacted, and they won’t be able to create another ID. Therefore, users are incentivized to use their linked wallet responsibly and avoid scamming others.

## Whiplano

### Description
Whiplano is revolutionizing art and tech with a groundbreaking rights distribution model that is fueled by community incentives. Artists can profit from their work before production, while buyers gain tools to invest in, enhance, produce, and sell creative content. At the core is our Tradable Rights Seed (TRS), combining NFT trading with multiplied rights to creative works. This innovative model taps into the rising demand for digital assets and physical collectibles, creating a new era in intellectual property and community-based production. Whiplano is driving the future, ensuring even the most novel projects reach their full potential

Furthermore, we have removed web3 accessibility barriers by creating a new technology called the Digital Asset Compass. This powerful technology associates PayPal and bank accounts with blockchain asset ownership without even the need for a wallet.

Vision: To create a vibrant community-driven ecosystem where creators, investors, and community will thrive in alignment and work together to achieve mutual success. As a result, creative projects will receive the full support they deserve and all involved will see a positive impact on free expression and quality-of-life. 

Mission: To establish a marketplace of ideas where intellectual property meets the blockchain as Tradable Rights Seeds (TRS). TRS empower creators to not only sell the rights to their works, but also to secure the legacy of that creative work to a fan base which can legally acquire the right to build upon it. Whiplano provides a dynamic solution that empowers freedom as the base for economy.

### Details

- **Country:** Germany
- **Additional Info:** The project is considered DePIN due to its ability to free handworkers to collect and produce art from IP rights. Humans are physical infrastructure!

App MVP is on route to completion at time of submission. Please contact galen.goodwick@icloud.com for demo.

## Solert

### Description
When disasters strike, people and economies may sink. Disasters can occur by way of errors in a software, distressed people in a community, leaking pipes on a ground, tax violations by a retailer, or rocks falling from the sky. Timely and reliable alerts can reduce chances of disasters. There exist several web2 based alerts platforms. Web3 in general and Solana in particular can play an important role in devising more reliable alterts systems. In a typical system, an agency attending to certain types of incidents will have a web3 webpage. Users can go to a relevant webpage, and report incidents they have noted. The agency can track this webpage, and take necessary actions.

SOLERT Alerts Systems is a Solana based Web3 dApp to report and track various types of alerts. This dApp has been hosted on a local computer, and ported on the domain taxai.us .

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** - YouTube video: https://youtu.be/yRrP0IIWhII
- Project overview: https://clinos.us
- Project demonstration: http://taxai.us (Please message me if this server is down when you visit.)
- Lalit A Patel: https://lipy.us/lalit/index.html
- Loom video (without SID): https://www.loom.com/share/524178486b5440a4853de6dd17888eab

Steps for trying this dApp at http://taxai.us :
- In Google Chrome, go to http://taxai.us.  (Please message me if this server is down when you visit.) This Solert webpage shows a journal in the top and a map in the bottom.
- From Google Chrome Extensions, open Solflare or Phantom Wallet Extension. The wallet should be set for your own account. Point it to Solana Devnet network. If the wallet has no SOL amount, add some SOL by Airdrop. On the webpage, click Select Wallet. Select Solflare Wallet. Connect the Wallet.
- If asked by the webpage, create a new alerts journal. Approve it in the wallet. Webpage will now show the created journal. The alert dialog box on the webpage requires latitude, longitude, and description of the incident you want to report.
- Write 44 -100 Water leaking a lot. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 44 -100.
- Write 38 -90 Someone yelling loudly. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 38 -90.
- Write 41 -110 Boat sinking. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 41 -110. Zoom the map if you need.
- Write Software not working. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, but the map will not add any marker, since the entry did not mention location.
- Write 44 -105 Heart attack. Click Publish on the box, and Approve on the wallet. The journal will add this entry, and the map will now add a marker at 44 -105.

Note:
- In the current version, the entry dialog box needs latitude and longitude for marking a location on the map. A later version will accept zip or address instead of latitude and longitude.
- The map feature consumes Lalit's quota for the Google Map API.

## InterBridge

### Description
Our project focuses on building a robust message and token bridge between the SVM and TVM ecosystems. The core functionality will support seamless token transfers, leveraging a general-purpose cross-chain message protocol. This ensures that both tokens and arbitrary messages can be sent and received across blockchains with strong replay prevention and message validation mechanisms. The project will consist of two implementation phases. The final result will be a fully decentralized, permissionless message protocol leverage wormhole for token and message transfers.

### Details

- **Country:** Malaysia
- **Additional Info:** Roadmap Overview:

We have a robust plan to enhance our protocol, ensuring increased security, scalability, and seamless cross-chain communication. Our roadmap includes three key versions:

Version 1: Launch with multi-sig relayers to enable secure cross-chain messaging and token transfers, ensuring a solid foundation for early adopters.

Version 2: Introduce Wormhole Guardians alongside cross-domain messaging, improving both security and flexibility as we scale.

Version 3: Implement Wormhole’s cross-domain messenger on TON, facilitating seamless communication and asset transfers between Solana and TON, further enhancing interoperability.

These progressive upgrades will make our protocol more secure, flexible, and scalable.

## pumpstake.fun

### Description
Current launchpads enable early traders to exploit exit liquidity from later investors, leading to quick market crashes. PumpStake.fun tackles this by introducing built-in staking/unstaking on the bonding curve. Traders can stake to receive coin allocation, but transfers only occur after reaching a $64K market cap, with 800M coins released. Additionally, $12K liquidity is added to AMM for 200M tokens, and tokens are burned.

To ensure long-term success post-launch, we are building an AMM that encourages coin holding and fosters community trust. We will generate derivative assets from memecoins and create a prediction market. Wallets holding from 0 to 64K MCAP will earn rare NFTs, with a 2% commission on NFT trades. These "hero" wallets will be celebrated, and we will build Layer 2 (L2) on top of trading data using NFTs, similar to how fantasy.top platform built L2 on Twitter, driving further engagement through competitions.

## iNFT, PoW NFT

### Description
Identifiable NFT, a new PoW way to publish NFT.

iNFT reflects scarcity based on mathematical probability. The lower the probability, the higher the scarcity, or in other words, the greater its value. Even iNFTs of different themes (IPs) can be compared in value by their generation probability.

There are two important elements in the casting process of iNFT, one is the template (i.e. the gene of iNFT), and the other is the unique hash, which is the block hash of the blockchain. The implementation method is to read the corresponding data in the gene according to the values ​​of different positions of the hash, and splice the image of iNFT. This is the process of casting an iNFT in the PoW method.
Since the block hash is unpredictable and cannot be tampered with, the iNFT obtained is also unique and cannot be forged. According to the setting of the gene, the scarcity can be judged to form a decentralized value recognition, that is, the value of iNFT is determined by the block hash.

## NIZER

### Description
NIZER is a game-changing protocol for communities and DAO.
This drive continuous growth by effectively circulating value within the community. 

# Solution
Our solution, the Sustainable Loop, It starts with voting, where members choose LST for staking. From there, the community owner strategically allocates rewards to recognize and motivate contributors. 

# Problem
This is built on the Founder’s firsthand experiences with repeated community rug pulls and challenging MOD activities. DAOs and web3 communities face deep-rooted issues in structure and sustainability. Nizer is here to solve that.

# Progress
After Sanctum announced their Creator Coins, we were of course asked, including by Sanctum themselves, how our service is different. Issuing LSTs is just the beginning. We’ve listened to community managers who have issued LSTs and identified the real challenges they face beyond issuance. We’re building solutions to address those problems. When we presented this solution to Sanctum, they responded with, “Very good, I agree.”

# Output
The program is still in its early stages, but our team has engaged in extensive discussions to identify real challenges and craft solutions. We’ve documented this process in detail on our GitBook. While the app isn’t fully ready yet, we are submitting our GitBook, which showcases a demo of the app we’re building and the hypotheses behind it.

# CTA
We received support from Superteam Japan for business viability and ecosystem connections, and from the Superteam VET for the technical foundation of our solutions. 
We believe that healthy communities are essential for Web3 and for Solana, its core player. And we’re confident that we can solve the current issues facing these communities and fix the failing schemes!

Pitch: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sfo2FqoCS0OL2FNVqN3MBPxDMChEtAAtNek1uJTiF9E/edit?usp=sharing

TL;DR:

We're creating a launchpad, but instead of sending the funds raised through "pools" to projects, the money will go to our developers for further contributions to these projects. After the project is launched and tokens are distributed to contributors and developers, the tokens will then be allocated to those who participated in our pools.

Simultaneously, users will receive tokens based on their share in the pool, which they can trade or speculate on.

Users get access to all top-tier projects where tokenomics include a drop for contributions (in 90% of projects).

Projects get quality contributions, developers get paid, and we get commissions and the opportunity to contribute.


For those who are not entirely clear about 'contribution', here are the latest projects and what they gave tokens for:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UBeVJbKfv-r1lGRqgDuqa-TnUcHEXCL4_BO15ElQNfQ/edit?usp=sharing

We also received positive feedback and even assistance from people at Hashed and LayerZero.

* Queued RPC calls
* Load balancing
* Active indexing
* Efficient and smart caching
* Zero-limit WebSocket proxy

Building a standard for transaction and account history dumps.
A transaction replayer that allows anyone to rebuild account history from transactions.
And a marketplace to share, sell, and buy data directly from projects without the constraints of RPC.

Our first demo for the hackathon will be an ORE dashboard showing actual graph of ore mined, not difficulty, CU, or transaction fees.

## NeBu Assets

### Description
NeBu is an RWA and lending protocol on Solana.

Traditional overseas financial investments, often have certain capital thresholds and costs. NeBu aims to establish compliant RWA investment channels, allowing all users to access globally high-security investment targets, eliminating investment thresholds and costs for users, and adding extra on-chain liquidity to traditional finance.

Our team members own a licensed financial company, which gives the NeBu team a significant advantage in terms of resources in the traditional financial industry compared to other Web3 teams. We are also in discussions to bring on a former JP Morgan Private Bank executive as an advisor to the project.

**Key highlights of NeBu:**

- Selected as one of the 13 winners out of approximately 150 applicants to join the accelerator co-hosted by SpringX and Solana.
- Awarded a grant by the Solana Superteam.
- Established partnerships with Pyth, OKX Web3, and Bitget.

With the help of local regulatory authorities and leading funds, the team is establishing such compliant investment channels in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Middle East. In the first phase, it is expected to provide:

- Malaysian Government Bonds - With the help of manager from leading national funds in Malaysia, we have mapped out the local compliance path.
- Singapore Bank Fixed Income - Provided by JP Morgan
- Middle East Infrastructure Products - Currently connecting with local regulatory authorities

Due to the US interest rate hikes over the past two years, more than $60 billion of web3 funds have been invested in US Treasury bonds. As the US dollar is about to enter a rate-cutting cycle, some funds will continue to seek other high-security investment targets. Some existing investors of Treasury bonds and fixed income products also hope to gain more returns. NeBu will attract both traditional finance and web3 funds simultaneously.

## Solana Publish

### Description
Solana Publish is a decentralized platform that enables creators to directly publish and sell their work using blockchain technology and NFTs. The platform eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries like publishers, allowing creators to retain full control over their content, distribution, and royalties.

Using Solana’s fast and low-cost transactions, Solana Publish ensures creators can easily monetize their content through NFTs, with automatic royalty payments handled by smart contracts. The project also aims to address a pressing issue in the current publishing landscape: many important works are overlooked because they don’t appeal to mainstream audiences or influencers. Solana Publish seeks to empower these marginalized voices and ensure their content reaches the people who need it most.

As a prototype, the project will collaborate with Solana Superteam to create a book on Solana and Web3 trends, demonstrating the model's viability. This model also addresses the challenges faced by creators in Japan, where many talented individuals struggle to get their works published. By providing a decentralized publishing solution, Solana Publish gives these creators a new platform to reach their audience and monetize their work effectively.

### Details

- **Country:** Japan
- **Additional Info:** As part of our prototype development, we plan to collaborate with the Solana Superteam to create a book focused on the latest trends in Solana and Web3. This book will serve as a proof of concept for our decentralized publishing platform, Solana Publish. By testing and validating this prototype, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. If successful, we will use this prototype as a basis to pitch our decentralized publishing approach to traditional publishers.

One of the key problems we aim to solve with Solana Publish is the lack of opportunities for creators in Japan. Despite the abundance of talented creators, many struggle to get their work published. Our platform provides these creators with a new way to independently publish their work using NFTs, bypassing traditional publishing gatekeepers and empowering them to reach their audience directly.

In a belief market you can place a bet on an answer to an arbitrary question. Like investing in stocks, people can buy shares of an answer, move the prices by publishing compelling information, and resell the shares at a higher price. Anyone can profit by providing evidence to the public, while being incentivized to be as accurate as possible, since market competition punishes biased information.

Profit = Liquidity x Information gain

Business Model:
Trading fees flow to liquidity providers and us.

Market:
Anyone can create a new market. Unlike prediction markets, there are no winners or losers, no settlement necessary, markets never close. No registration, no KYC. Appealing to DeFi users and traders as well as information providers.

Traction:
Just finished the MVP. Small pilot test with 3 people performed.

## $YESBUT

### Description
We are a project born to become the web3 branch of the popular YES, BUT meme series, created by the artist Anton Gudim—a well-known brand with millions of followers and viral success. The brand already offers physical products, such as books, board games, and prints.

The web3 project started with a token created by the artist himself but faced early setbacks due to unprofessional teams that hindered its growth. We have since regained control for Gudim, and our goal is to unlock the project’s potential to introduce Solana to a broader mainstream audience, particularly meme enthusiasts, illustration fans, and collectors.

Our vision includes:

Mini-games (both off-chain and on-chain) based on YES, BUT lore. These games will be interactive, fun, and accessible on any device. Prototypes are already underway, although we currently lack expert on-chain developers due to limited resources.

Digital and physical collectibles, such as NFTs and a full range of merchandise. These products aim to bridge the gap between web3 and the "normie" world.

Collaborations with entities in the Solana ecosystem. As a brand close to the mainstream audience, we aim to become Solana ambassadors, connecting the vast YES, BUT fanbase with Solana's ecosystem—be it mobile devices, gaming platforms, collectibles, or payment gateways.

YES, BUT has the potential to introduce a new wave of users to Solana, making it one of the most exciting projects to open doors for the ecosystem.

## PUNK

### Description
We're building CLperpAMM for HFTs and Pro traders on Solana
All DEXes on Solana have already managed to move all the liquidity to Concentrated Liquiduty markets. Now, we want to deploy perp markets with the same capital efficiency

Our big goal is to bring better on-chain leverage to Solana, not just for major assets but also for meme tokens and other Solana native tokens. With a focus on trading experience and trading SDK, we plan to give projects the ability to have a leverage on their tokens and allow users to hedge any tokens. Those are just a few of our expected features.

Our team came together to bring our experience from major DeFi and trading projects like Overnight, Lumio, Ton, Kwenta, Fluence, Lyra, Tiger Trade, Spark, meme trading bots and infra, as well as consulting hft funds.

## SOLPASS

### Description
Solpass is a decentralized identity verification protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It enables users to complete quests, earning points for their verified wallet addresses. By integrating Reclaim for identity verification, Solpass ensures a tamper-proof proof-of-humanity system, empowering users to verify their identities in a secure and decentralized manner while participating in Solana-based activities.

### Details

- **Country:** Nigeria
- **Additional Info:** With the exponential growth of decentralised finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), the need for secure, reliable human verification is critical. Fraudulent activities, including bot usage, airdrop farming, and Sybil attacks, pose significant challenges to the sustainability of blockchain ecosystems.

Solpass provides a solution by integrating human verification through Reclaim, where users can prove their identity of their wallet address while maintaining privacy. Solpass will serve as a foundational layer for dApps, enabling trust, reducing fraud, and ensuring that users are real.

Developers can leverage the Solpass API to query detailed information such as an address's points, completed quests, and available quests, enabling seamless integration of user verification and engagement data into their applications.

## memepot.fun

### Description
memepot is the first lottery infrastructure on Solana built with several in-game dynamics that allow token projects to raise liquidity (in SOL), increase token holders count and create a custom engaging experience for their community across any social media.

Players have 60 minutes to buy lottery keys and increase their dividends quota to compete for the final grand prize. With large prizes (the memepot), non-stop dividends and lots of hopium, the winner is the last to buy the key.

The trick? Every key extends the game by 10 seconds

### Details

- **Country:** Indonesia
- **Additional Info:** As a main go-to-market, memepot.fun uses meme tokens to attract attention and engage with users, but the bigger goal is to create a universal lottery system that any token project can use. Think of Zealy, but more engaging and bot-free - this will be a system that helps projects grow their community, increase the number of token holders, and boost liquidity. 

With features like bonding curves, voting phases, and non-stop dividends, memepot.fun is designed to keep people engaged and make the whole experience rewarding for both players and token projects.

We are a team of three engineers with a combined 29 years of experience in Web3. We have a strong background in building blockchain systems, social engagement tools, and meme-based projects. All 3 have worked on well-known protocols on Ethereum, and are now focused on building on Solana.

## ReNa

### Description
Despite growing awareness, many individuals struggle to consistently adopt 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) practices due to a lack of motivation, engagement, and a clear understanding of their environmental impact. Recycling can be confusing with people often unsure how to identify and sort materials properly. Current recycling programs and platforms fail to provide sufficient incentives or community support, making it challenging to encourage active participation and foster lasting behavior change. 

RENA addresses these challenges by leveraging AI-powered image recognition and a work-to-earn model to incentivize recycling. The platform educates users through engaging content, including posters and resources that enhance recycling knowledge. Additionally, RENA collaborates with recycling organizations (NGOs) to create programs and campaigns that encourage active participation. All these features aim to build a vibrant and engaged community focused on sustainability and recycling. ReNa is not just an app—it's a movement towards a greener future where everyone can contribute, connect, and make a difference.Alignment with Sustainability Goals: The project promotes 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) practices, which align with Malaysia’s environmental sustainability goals. By encouraging recycling and reducing waste, it contributes to the national agenda of sustainable development.

Community Engagement: The project involves organizing community events, such as beach cleanups and recycled art workshops, fostering a sense of community and collective responsibility. This engagement helps in raising environmental awareness and building a supportive network around sustainable practices.

Innovative Use of Technology: Incorporating AI recognition for scanning recyclables and gamification features to earn points makes the project innovative. This aligns with Malaysia's push towards digital transformation and smart solutions in everyday life.

Educational Component: By providing workshops, educational booths, and interactive activities, the project educates the public about the importance of recycling and how to do it effectively. This education aligns with Malaysia’s goals to increase environmental literacy and awareness.

Youth Involvement: Engaging younger generations through mini-games and social media features attracts youth participation, which is crucial for building long-term sustainable habits. This fits into the Malaysia SuperTeam’s objective of fostering youth involvement in national development initiatives.

Scalability and Replicability: The project's model, including community events, AI technology, and gamification, can be scaled up and replicated across different regions in Malaysia. This scalability makes it a valuable addition to nationwide efforts in promoting sustainability.

## Posting to receive tokens based on votes.

### Description
Posting to receive tokens based on votes refers to a system where users create posts, and other users vote on them. The more positive votes (likes, upvotes, etc.) a post receives, the more tokens (a form of cryptocurrency or digital asset) the creator earns. This incentivizes high-quality or popular content creation, as posts that gain more attention and approval generate more rewards. This model is common in decentralized social media platforms or blockchain-based applications where tokens have value.

## WAIGER

### Description
We're building WAIGER.com, an AI-powered, peer-to-peer iGaming platform for real money. Our unique games and social-first approach create a fresh, rewarding ecosystem with real token utility and dynamic NFTs. Blending GameFi, MMORPG-style retention, and Web3, we offer a seamless experience with minimum Web3 friction.

Players level up their AI-powered character through gameplay, marketplace activities, and social engagement, unlocking rewards and monetization opportunities along the way.

Starting with Poker, our game state and logic are off-chain for performance, while transactions and prizing will be provably fair on-chain for transparency.  Powered by Solana, we leverage Gameshift for integrations, dynamic NFTs, and progression mechanics... reducing the need for heavy Rust development early on.

We're expanding into Sports and Casino games (P2P), launching a Telegram mini-game in November, and rolling out our community with leaderboards, competitions and airdrops that funnel into our production launch in Q1 2025.

## BattleBoosters

### Description
BattleBoosters is a fantasy MMA NFT card game that offers players a thrilling, immersive experience based on real MMA league fights. It allows players to collect, trade, and compete using NFT Fighters and Boosters in a strategic, tournament-based environment.

How the Game Works:

1 - Acquiring NFT Fighters & Boosters

Players start by acquiring NFT Fighters through packs, which are priced at $125 for 5 NFT Fighters. Boosters, which enhance gameplay, are available for purchase at $1.25 each for  5 NFT Boosters.

Assets purchased through the official BattleBoosters website are immediately accessible in-game. However, they need to be minted on the blockchain if players wish to withdraw them. NFT Fighters acquired from external sources must be deposited into the game 
via the website to be usable in tournaments.


2 - Entering Tournaments:

With NFT Fighters in their collection, players can enter tournaments by navigating to the draft tab. Tournaments are categorized 
similarly to MMA league events into "Early prelims," "Prelims," and the "Main card."

          2.1 - For each fight in a tournament, players must select the fighter they believe will win the match. 

          2.2 - They then assign one of their NFT Fighters to represent that prediction, choosing a combat style that closely matches the actual fighter's style in the upcoming match.

          2.3 - Additionally, players can enhance their chances by assigning one booster per category: Points (points multiplier), Shield (increases the life of the NFT Fighter, reducing damage taken),


3 - Scoring and Damage Evaluation

After each tournament match, players can review the performance of their NFT Fighters and Boosters.

The scoring system evaluates both the number of points collected during combat and the damage dealt. Each fighter’s points are 
determined by correct fight predictions, while damage is calculated based on the fighter’s performance, including successful use of 
boosters. Players can analyze these stats to refine their strategies for future tournaments.


4 - Collecting Rewards

Once the tournament ends, players can check their rankings and claim rewards based on their performance. 

   Rewards include:
       - $SOL tokens
       - NFT Fighters
       - NFT Boosters
       - Champions Pass 


Conclusion

BattleBoosters combines the strategic depth of a collectible card game with the excitement of real-world MMA, making it a unique and engaging experience for both gamers and MMA fans. Whether you’re looking to dominate the leaderboards or build a valuable collection of NFTs, BattleBoosters offers endless possibilities.

## QSTN

### Description

### Details

- **Country:** United States
- **Additional Info:** QSTN is an AI-powered survey marketplace that allows businesses to fund surveys using Solana tokens and NFTs, rewarding participants while ensuring user consent via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).

QSTN employs smart contracts for the automated distribution of rewards, making the process transparent and tamper-proof. These smart contracts trigger the release of rewards once survey conditions are met, without the need for manual intervention. Businesses can fund surveys using tokens or NFTs, offering flexibility and innovative, tangible rewards that can appreciate in value.

We utilize zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs serve as immutable proof of participation, allowing users to claim rewards while maintaining complete privacy. The system verifies participation without accessing any private data.

QSTN addresses the significant challenge of engaging users in surveys, which often leads to low response rates and poor data quality in traditional methods. By incorporating gamification elements such as leaderboards, points, and digital rewards, QSTN makes the survey experience more engaging and rewarding. Our innovative reward mechanisms, including NFTs and digital tokens, attract a wider audience and provide tangible benefits to users, fostering long-term engagement and loyalty.

## Nomadz

### Description
Community-driven property rental platform. We will revolutionize the rental industry by providing features like Tik-Tok style video marketing, crypto payment integrations, collaborative booking and action-based rewards programs.

### Details

- **Country:** Ukraine
- **Additional Info:** We have launched a beta testing with RateHawk integration (2.5 million properties agregated from platforms like Expedia) for ICP community with 700 applications. We realised that tech infrastructure for mobile and community is not ready for the mass adoption. We received a grant from Superteam to build it on Solana. Now we participate at the Founders Villa by Superteam UAE and partner up with Superteam members and leaders. We are staying here for 3 weeks to build partnerships, learn and onboard investors to our seed round. Also, we are staying in Nas House and Nuseir Yassin is interested in our project. We plan to onboard his as an angel and ambassador to promote our platform and his properties. 

We have 120 active community members in telegram and 8,000+ followers on X with 510k impressions during the past 3 months and an engagement rate of 15%.

We have sold our 2 NFT collections (900 NFTs) with Villas totaling over $40,000 which is huge considering 5k DAU on ICP.  We are the most succesfull NFT collection launched on ICP in 2024. We plan to launch 3 more collections to grow community and generate revenue. We have spent 0$ on Ambassadors, organised 5 metaverse events and 4 events on villas worldwide (Kyiv, Lisbon, Barcelona, Dubai). 

Developers are highly proactive, participated in 3 hackathons and gathered a wealth of feedback.

Additionally, we have opened a legal entity in Estonia (now opening in Dubai), signed contract with RateHawk (booking agregator) and moving to Dubai to organise more community events for web3 founders in Nas House and other places worldwide.

## RxNet

### Description
Rx is an abbreviation for prescriptions, which is what we help with.

Drug abuse, particularly prescription drug abuse, is becoming an increasingly large problem and the fact that it's so easy to cheat prescriptions is a big part of this. RxNet solves this by streamlining the process of giving prescriptions (as a doctor), and more importantly, verifying prescriptions (as a pharmacy).

Dctors can use RxNet to hand out prescriptions as NFTs to patients, which are public transactions. Smart contracts are used to verify their identities and pharmacists can easily verify these before handing medication to the patient.

In the future, RxNet can also be used to handle manufacturing/distribution of drugs, targeting all parts of the supply chain from factory to patient to reduce fraud.

## Neutral Trade

### Description
Neutral Trade is the on-chain multi-strategy hedge fund, built by experienced quants and traders from Goldman Sachs, Barclays and a Top 3 Global Hedge Fund, along with experienced web3 developers. 

We tokenize cutting-edge trading strategies for investors seeking stable, risk-adjusted returns through delta-neutral trading strategies. Our first product, the JLP Delta Neutral Vault, operates on Drift’s perpetual markets, utilizing advanced quantitative methods to ensure zero exposure to market fluctuations while maximizing profitability.

We aim to tokenize hedge fund strategies that are usually only offered to professional investors and high net worth individuals, bringing it accessible to all. We aim to bring in off-exchange settlement solution such that we could tap into CeFi trading strategies if we get funding for our submission. 

Building on-chain on Solana makes the most sense seeing a vibrant DeFi community and builders support. We strive to be the web3 Millennium where we help professional traders find the market for their trading strategies, while providing the transparency, accessibility, and non-custodial options to the everyday user.

### Details

- **Country:** Hong Kong
- **Additional Info:** Team Background:

- Ex-Crypto exchange operator, CFA and CPA, ex-Barclays and Deloitte
- Ex-Goldmans Sachs Quant Developer and Hedge Fund Trader (Index Rebalance Team)
- 2 Senior Web3 Developer building Dapps since 2020

Why are we building this product:

- As traders, we have built a Crypto hedge fund but realized the friction is huge - you need to set up a proper legal structure, documentations, paying fees to third parties like auditors, legal counsel, prime brokers, custodian and fund admin. Moreever, you'll need to spend a lot of time doing roadshows and fundraising, and couldn't do what you do best - trading. Also, it takes a couple of months to go through all the KYC process for CEX for business / corporate accounts.
- We realized blockchain offers a path to build an on-chain hedge fund, offering transparent track record, global accessibility, and non-custodial options for the end user.  It totally removes traditional barriers through smart contract.
- More info is in our docs.

Target Audience:

- Professional Crypto Quant Traders who’s looking for capital to trade
- Retail who want their money to be managed by professional traders without paying hefty fees

Long Term Vision:

- Onchain multi-strategy hedge fund, utilizing liquidity from both CEX and DEX, while offering on-chain transparency.
- Strategy-backed leverage, allowing under collateralized lending since the collateral is a tokenized high sharpe strategy
- Community owned hedge fund with a basket of competitive hedge fund strategies for the end users to choose from, offering the best infrastructure, datasets and tooling for quant traders to trade
