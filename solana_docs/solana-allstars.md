# Solana Allstars

**Solana Allstars** is a global educational program aimed at teaching and promoting Solana blockchain technology, as well as the various projects that are part of its ecosystem. This program is driven by [**Step Finance**](https://www.step.finance/) and sponsored by multiple projects that are building on the Solana platform.

Currently, Solana Allstars is present in four countries:

- **Turkey**
- **Nigeria**
- **Venezuela**
- **Argentina**

The program focuses on touring each country, offering free and continuous talks in different cities. Every time a new city is launched, a free talk is organized every 15 to 20 days, thus providing constant access to up-to-date and relevant information about the Solana ecosystem.

The topics covered in these talks are varied and include areas such as Gaming, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Programming, and other important aspects related to Solana. This allows participants to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and tools offered by this blockchain.

Additionally, opportunities for collaboration are opened in each country, creating positions for ambassadors, collaborators, Regional Managers, and Country Managers. This not only fosters the growth of the program but also allows participants to actively engage in promoting education and the adoption of blockchain technology in their communities.

Solana Allstars represents a valuable initiative to empower people with blockchain knowledge, thus contributing to the development of a more informed and participatory environment in the crypto space. As the program expands, it is expected that more cities will join this mission, fostering connection and learning in a constantly evolving ecosystem.
