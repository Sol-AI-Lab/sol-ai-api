# Local Solana

**Local Solana** is a platform where peer-to-peer payments are made in a decentralized and self-custodial manner, directly from your wallet. They offer the ability to trade cryptocurrencies and fiat, facilitating the exchange of SOL as well as memecoins and stablecoins.

Local Solana is a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange inspired by [**LocalBitcoins**](https://localbitcoins.com/), allowing you to connect with others in your country to make transactions with fiat and Solana tokens, such as USDC. The platform is designed to be intuitive and accessible, ensuring that both beginners and experienced users can easily and securely conduct their transactions.

The Local Solana team is responsible for listing a set of selected markets to facilitate your transactions. At the time of its launch, you will be able to access markets for SOL, USDC, and USDT, allowing you to diversify your operations and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Solana ecosystem.

If you are interested in launching a P2P market for your own coin, don't hesitate to contact the Local Solana team.

Local Solana believes in the power of decentralization and in the ability of users to manage their own assets. Their mission is to offer a platform that empowers people, allowing them to make transactions quickly, securely, and efficiently.
