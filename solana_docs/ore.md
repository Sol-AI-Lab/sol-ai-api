# ORE

**ORE** is an exciting project developed on the Solana network that stood out by winning the first Colloseum hackathon in 2024. This project features a proof-of-work token that anyone can mine, allowing individuals to participate in the mining process through a simple website and/or command line. ORE not only represents a new way of mining but also promotes inclusion and accessibility in the world of cryptocurrency mining.
